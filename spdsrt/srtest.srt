我没有时间了 我爸妈下星期就要来这里了
I don't have time. You see, my parents are gonna be here in a week

00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,370
- 小抱怨鬼 - 我还没说过爱这个字吧

181
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,380
等你有能力分摊房租再说吧
Maybe a little bit closer when you're covering your half of the rent.

山姆 我真不知道该怎么跟那妞相处
You know, Sam, I don't know about moving in with this chick.

194
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,780
她要是像上一任那样甩了咱们可怎么办？
What if she dumps us like the last girl?

195
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,920
她凶巴巴的 我不喜欢她
She was mean. Didn't like her.

196

不 我们可不是一家人 你不过是外星难民
No, we are not family. You're a political refugee,

200
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,460
我好不容易才找了一个欣赏我的人
and I have finally found someone who appreciates me for me.

201
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,550
那你得告诉她 我们不是你的宠物
Well, you tell her that we're not your pets,

202
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,930

00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,040
不错
Right.

438
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,840
太好了 他们来了！
Good, you're here!

439
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,050
我叫Q
Me name's Que.

440
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,930
我真希望你们能对他有所交代 我从没见过他如此生气
I do hope you have answers for him. I've never seen him so upset.

441
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,350
擎天柱 还记得夏洛特·梅琳吗？
Optimus, you remember Charlotte Mearing?

442
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,600
我们的国家情报部门局长？
Our Director of National Intelligence?

443
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:12,600
他情绪不太好
He's in a bad mood.

444
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:14,860
今天不想和任何人说话
He's not talking to anybody today.

445
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,890
这算什么意思 搞无声抗议吗？
What is this, the silent treatment?

446
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:20,650
- 那个我们知道 这是两码事 - 肯定不是
- We've seen that and this is not that. - Definitely not.

447
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,450
比那还严重
This is worse.

448
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:24,990
擎天柱！你总得有所表示吧！
Prime! Make something of yourself!

449
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,330
他都气疯了
He's pissed.

450
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:34,880
你骗了我们
You lied to us.

451
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,130
你们说过一切有关我们星球的情报都会共享
Everything humans know of our planet we were told had all been shared.

452
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,960
那这东西为什么会在人类的手里？
So why was this found in human possession?

453
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,300
我们起初也蒙在鼓里
We were in the dark on this also.

454
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,380
这事目前在第七区也只有局长知情
It was Director Only clearance at Sector 7 until now.

455
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,560
我的皮包
The bag.

456
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:52,390
- 哪个皮包？ - 爱马仕铂金包 绿色鸵鸟皮的那个！
- Which bag? - Hermes. Birkin. Green ostrich!

457
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,850
哦 我的天
Oh, my God.

458
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:00,400
这个秘密只有极少数人知道 目前在世的更是没几个
This is a secret few men knew, and fewer still remain alive.

459
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:01,980
容我向你介绍一下
Allow me to please introduce to you

460
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:04,660
两位国家航空航天局的行动组要员…
two of NASA's founding mission directors

461
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,950
以及宇航员巴兹·奥尔德林博士
and astronaut Dr. Buzz Aldrin,

462
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,450
他是当年首次登月的两位人类先驱之一
one of the first two men to step foot on the moon.

463
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:12,280
这位是擎天柱首领
Sir? Optimus Prime.

464
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,870
你我都曾遨游太空 很荣幸见到你
From a fellow space traveler, it's a true honor.

465
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,380
见到您我也很荣幸
The honor is mine.

466
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,700
我们在60年代的整个太空军备竞赛
Our entire space race of the 1960s, it appears,

467
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,730
全都是针对一件事
was in response to an event.

468
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:30,220
我们的宇航员调查了一艘坠毁的外星飞船
Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.

469
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:31,840
但并未发现幸存者
No survivors onboard.

470
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,100
上头要求我们严守秘密
We were sworn to secrecy by our Commander in Chief.

471
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,940
这项任务绝不能对任何人透露
This was a mission you will never speak of.

472
00:27:39,030 --> 00:27:40,110
明白 长官
I understand, sir.

473
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,400
在国航局总共有35个人知道这计划的真相
A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.

474
00:27:44,490 --> 00:27:47,450
苏联成功发射了无人登月探测器
Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.

475
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,820
他们大概是在那时取走了那根燃料棒
Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.

476
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,280
我相信苏联人发现了
We believe the Russians deduced

477
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,410
那燃料棒可以进行核裂变反应
that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly,

478
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,590
并在切尔诺贝利核电站对其进行实验
believed they had it mastered, and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.

479
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,000
我们共组织了6次登月行动
We landed six missions in all.

480
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:03,710
拍下了数百幅照片 采集了样本
We took hundreds of photos and samples.

481
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,590
并将其永久封存
We locked them away forever,

482
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,510
之后探月计划便终止了
and the moon program was shut down.

483
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,840
你们搜查过防撞逃生舱吗？
Well, did you search the crash vault?

484
00:28:12,730 --> 00:28:15,520
那艘飞船名叫「方舟」
The ship's name was the Ark.

485
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:18,520
我曾亲眼看着它逃离塞伯坦
I watched it escape Cybertron myself.

486
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:23,240
船上携带了一项汽车人的科技 本可以帮助我们赢得战争
It was carrying an Autobot technology which would have won us the war.

487
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,310
还有它的船长…
And its captain.

488
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,230
船长是谁？
Who was its captain?

489
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:31,240
伟大的御天敌 那项技术的发明者
The great Sentinel Prime, the technology's inventor.

490
00:28:31,330 --> 00:28:35,070
他也是汽车人的领袖 我的前任
He was commander of the Autobots before me.

491
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,780
我必须找到方舟
It's imperative that I find it

492
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,790
而且抢在霸天虎获悉它的方位之前
before the Decepticons learn of its location.

493
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:43,790
我们汽车人的宇宙飞船有能力飞往月球
Our Autobot spacecraft has the ability to get there.

494
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:47,470
所以 你们必须祈祷这还来得及
And you must pray it's in time.

495
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,100
嗨 我找卡莉·斯宾塞
Hi. I'm here to see Carly Spencer.

496
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,820
卡莉！
Carly!

497
00:29:09,030 --> 00:29:10,660
失陪一下
Excuse me.

498
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,910
- 你找到工作了？ - 简直不可思议
- You got the job? - This is crazy.

499
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:17,160
- 你真的找到了？ - 是的
- You really got it? - Yes.

500
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:19,490
看 我怎么说的来的？ 兔子给你好运气
See, what did I tell you? It's the bunny.

501
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,790
你也太客气了
You are so welcome.

502
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,000
- 是不是更爱我了？ - 好感度上升了点
- Do you like me more? - A little bit, yeah.

503
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:25,210
你只说你是他的助理馆长
You said you were his assistant curator,

504
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,760
你没说过这家伙拥有这么个宝贝啊
you didn't say the guy owns Space Mountain.

505
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,090
是吧 这里很漂亮吧？
I know. Isn't it beautiful in here?

506
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,900
而且我老板也是个超酷的家伙
And he's the coolest guy. Ever.

507
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,300
- 是吗？ - 是的
- Yeah?    - Yeah.

508
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:33,470
山姆
Sam.

509
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,760
迪伦·古尔德
Dylan Gould.

510
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,180
嘿 幸会
Hey. A pleasure to meet you.

511
00:29:40,270 --> 00:29:43,270
幸会 卡莉经常向我提起你
Pleasure meeting you. Carly's told me a lot about you.

512
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,690
呃 她也常跟我提起您 这里真的挺漂亮
Well, vice versa. It's a beautiful building you got.

513
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,320
像进取号星舰（《星际旅行》）的场景
It's like the Starship Enterprise in here.

514
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,940
过奖 这里也漏雨
Thank you very much. It leaks.

515
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,900
在卡莉来帮忙打理之前
Before Carly came to help run the collection,

516
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,700
这整个场馆还是一团糟呢
it was just a complete mess.

517
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:55,030
但是现在装修工作总算重回正轨了
But now, the restorations are back on track.

518
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,160
我们要去今年的圆石滩巡展
We're going to Pebble Beach this year,

519
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:58,280
再赢一座奖杯回来
and we're gonna get a trophy for that stand right there.

520
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,210
你知道为什么吗？因为眼前这位小美女
You know why? Because this woman right here

521
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:03,620
- 就是我的秘密武器 - 是的
- is my secret weapon. - Okay.

522
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:07,130
古尔德先生 别这样 您过奖了 我只是负责组织工作
Mr. Gould, please, you exaggerate. All I've done is get you organized.

523
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:09,750
哦 你的功劳可多得多呢 我的公爵夫人
You've done much more than that, my Duchess.

524
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,380
都开始用昵称了 有意思
Nicknames, that's fun.

525
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,460
没错 公爵夫人
Yeah. The Duchess.

526
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,640
她人见人爱
She's adorable.

527
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,020
我把她从英国大使馆挖过来时
You know, when I stole her away from the British Embassy,

528
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,680
对她说 治国有何难？
I said, "It's easy to manage a country.

529
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:22,140
还不如来管理无价的艺术收藏品
"Try managing a priceless collection of art."

530
00:30:22,230 --> 00:30:26,940
看看这辆1939年出厂的德拉哈耶-165敞篷跑车
Tak e a look at this 1939 Delahaye 165 Cabriolet.

531
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:28,110
法国人设计的
Designed by a Frenchman.

532
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,400
瞧瞧她的曲线 如此优雅 美丽
Look at the curves. Elegant, isn't it? Beautiful.

533
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,030
性感
Sensual.

534
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,370
如同窈窕淑女的曲线
Built to evoke the body of the ideal woman.

535
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,070
跟我来
Come on.

536
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,600
我父亲只靠一张破烂书桌和一个梦想
My dad had a $ 10 desk and a dream,

537
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:44,440
就建立了一个商业帝国
and he built it into an empire.

538
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,420
哇
Wow.

539
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,750
我们现在是全美最大的会计事务所
We're the largest accounting firm in the U.S.

540
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,200
他去世之后我从创投部门开始
I started up the venture side after he passed.

541
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,580
投资未来
Invest in the future.

542
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:55,170
试着把赌注压到获胜者的那一方
Try and bet on the winners.

543
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:58,010
而收集名车能帮助我在赌局中保持理智
See, collecting cars helps me keep my sanity.

544
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,470
看起来不错
You guys look great.

545
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:10,890
那天确实不错 古尔德先生
That was a great day, Mr. Gould.

546
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:13,030
- 我没见过这张 - 我也没看过呢
- I haven't seen that one. - No. Me, neither.

547
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,730
牛仔裤太紧了
Jeans are tight.

548
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:19,160
我们走 我们走 你都看见了？
Here we go. Here we go. You see that?

549
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,740
又以车取人了？
Judgment. Judging a man by his car?

550
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,410
他以车取人的时候 你居然无动于衷？
And you're gonna wave at him while he's judging me?

551
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,100
你怎么啦？ 他是我老板吶
What's with you? He's my boss.

552
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,600
这份工作提供我们的食物和租金
This job pays for our food, our rent.

553
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:26,400
行 我全明白了
No, I totally understand.

554
00:31:26,410 --> 00:31:28,200
我是无所谓 我饿不着
I'm totally fine. I get it. I'm well fed.

555
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,210
知道吗？我不再是你的男孩玩具了
And guess what? I'm not your boy toy anymore.

556
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,010
我也穿正装了 看见没？
I got my big boy pants on. You see them?

557
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,300
请上车 谢谢 公爵夫人
In the car. Thank you, Duchess.

558
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:36,090
哦 天啊 他对你构成威胁了吗？
Oh, my God. Are you threatened by him?

559
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:43,600
威胁？我怕他什么？怕他有钱？有权？长得帅？
Threatened? What am I threatened by? His money? His power? His good looks?

560
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,050
全都是浮云 记好了！
None of the above. Check!

561
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:47,180
天啊！你吃醋的样子还真性感
God! Your temper tantrums are so sexy.

562
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,390
上车吧 拜托了
Get in the car, please.

563
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,480
山姆 他又不是第一个对我笑的男人
Sam, he's hardly the first man to ever smile at me.

564
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:53,860
- 我自有分寸    - 等等 等等
- I think I can handle it. - Hold on, hold on.

565
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:57,190
可你也冲他笑了 别说你没笑 好吗？
It's the smiling back part that gets me. Okay?

566
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,990
那我不笑了 以后不朝他笑了 我发誓
No more smiles. Never again. I promise.

567
00:31:59,410 --> 00:32:00,820
这话我爱听
That works for me.

568
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:10,910
别急 别急！那样可发动不了
Easy! Easy! You're not gonna get it started that way.

569
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:14,040
我是在做准备 我只完成了32％的修复
Well, I was just getting it ready. I'm about 32% done with my restoration.

570
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,220
一些镀铬零件 加上扰流板就搞定了
Some chrome work, put a spoiler on the back. Done deal.

571
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,630
卡莉一直在说你找工作很辛苦
You know, Carly's been telling me you've been struggling job-wise.

572
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,260
所以让你知道
Just so you know,

573
00:32:20,350 --> 00:32:21,900
我也是埃克塔系统公司的董事
I'm on the board for Accuretta Systems,

574
00:32:21,910 --> 00:32:23,710
我跟他们打了个招呼
and I put in a call for you.

575
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:25,300
这事就我们俩知道就行了 好吗？
Let's keep it between us, okay?

576
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:26,880
她对你太好了
She's so proud of you.

577
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,310
你真是个幸运儿
You're a lucky man.

578
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:35,650
苍耳号 接近月球静海基地
Xanthium approaching Tranquility Base.

579

你让我做的事情我都做了！

你刚才在隔间里跨在我身上

我打个电话就可以把你炒掉

我该回来吗？ 我该什么时候再过来？
Should I come back? When should I come back?

741

等你学会礼貌再来！

我不认识他！我什么都没说！
I don't know him! I would never say anything!

好吧 好吧！是我破坏了测图卫星

我能在程序中设一个盲点作为奖励

752
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,040
去你的吧
Shit!

753
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,930
贱货 想尝尝鸡肉大餐吗？

大家注意 没错 有同事死了
Come on, people. Yes, a workmate died,

761
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:02,630
但是光看窗外是不会令他复活的
but looking out the window is not going to bring him back.

762
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:03,880
他得了抑郁症
The man was depressed.

763
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:05,010
别拍照！
Don't take a picture!

764

你们可以一直看 但他不会站起来
You can keep watching him, but he's not getting up.

765

你们都看过“ 汉普蒂邓普蒂” 好吗？
You all read "Humpty Dumpty." Okay?

766
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:09,920
（童谣中从墙上摔下跌得粉碎的蛋形矮胖子）

767
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:12,310
维特维奇
Witwicky.

768

771
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:23,570
看到下面的人行道了吗？

听着 我不会说出刚才看到的事情
Listen, I'm not gonna say anything about what I saw.

775
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:34,660
你和谁共用一间厕所完全是你个人的事
Who you share a toilet stall with is totally your business.

776
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:37,490
这一定是日货
This is exceedingly Japanese.

777
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,210
日货使用从来不会简单化 不是吗？
They never make it easy, do they?

778
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,120
- 你怎么了？ - 出大事了 卡莉 好吗？
- What is with you? - This is the real deal, Carly, okay?

779
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,200

780
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:25,320
这是真事 我等一下会给你解释
It's real life. I'll explain it to you later.

We've got an emergency. You gotta get Colonel Lennox out here.

786
00:45:38,230 --> 00:45:39,600
你们保护什么 结肠瘘袋？
What are you protecting, colostomy bags?

787
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:40,980
便盆？ 止咳糖浆？
Bedpans? Throat lozenges?

788
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,560
你们的帽子从哪里来的 护理学校？
Where'd you get that hat from, nursing school?

789
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,360
难道说你们是在保卫护士和脚气药粉？真有趣
So, you're nurses and foot-powder protectors? Fantastic.

790
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,530
- 宝贝 - 在呢
- Babe. - Yes.

791
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,690
我认为我们没有走错
I don't think we're in the right place.

792
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,770
我们找对地方了
We are in the right place.

793
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,900
我们找的就是这里 我要和擎天柱讲话
We're in the right place and I'm gonna talk to Optimus right now.

794
00:45:49,990 --> 00:45:50,950
- 马上带我去见擎天柱 - 先生
- You're gonna get Optimus out here. - Sir.

795
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,020
先生 我想你来错地方了
Sir, you got the wrong building.

796
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,110
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

797
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,910
“霸天虎杀回来了” 你们哪句话没听懂？
What part of "Decepticons are back" do you not understand?

798
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,580
你！最好放明白点！
Yo! You being a smartass?

799
00:45:57,670 --> 00:46:00,660
别碰我的车！ 这可是古董！

800
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,000

I wouldn't do that.

801
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,330

807
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:18,930
你们…

Are you kidding me?

809

你们就是这样对待汽车人吗？都是自己人
This how you treat Autobots? We're on the same team.

813
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:35,240
祝你将来在7-11便利店打工愉快 白痴
Yeah, enjoy your next job at 7-Eleven, dickhead.

814
00:46:35,330 --> 00:46:37,160
- 说得没错 - 浑球

815
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,990
你的车呢？
How's your car now?

816
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:49,420

我知道你们的秘密行动很重要

824
00:47:02,230 --> 00:47:04,560
你就不能回车库待一晚上吗？
You can't come to the garage and just hang out one night?

825
00:47:04,650 --> 00:47:06,770
山姆 这话让我好难过

826
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,390
是的 我希望你感到难过 你应该感到难过

827
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,500
看看我现在开的这辆破车
Look at the jalopy I'm driving now.

828
00:47:09,510 --> 00:47:10,930
我每天都感到难过
I feel bad every single day.

829
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,610
你 你们两个都过来 伦诺克斯要见你们

什么 你们不再扣留我们了？

831
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,530
对不起 他们过于粗暴了
I'm sorry, babe. They were very rude, all right?

832
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:21,580
你得给我去修车 你以为会没事？
And you're fixing my car. You don't think so?

833
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,920
举起你的手来 如果出现一个飞行变态忍者影印机
Raise your hand if you had a flying psycho-ninja copier

834
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:24,990
尽力想杀死你！
trying to kill you today!

835
00:47:25,090 --> 00:47:26,170
这是我的指节铜环
Those are my brass knuckles.

836
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,170
那是我的脚环 也需要我脱掉吗？
That's my anklet. Do I have to take that off, too?

837
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,290
脚趾环呢？
And my toe rings?

838
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:31,250
所有NEST的官员撤离本层
All NEST officials clear the floor.

839
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,430
距离接触行动还有10分钟
We have 10 minutes until attempted contact.

840
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:35,790
我们获得了五件仪器
We've taken possession of the five devices

841
00:47:35,890 --> 00:47:38,600
它们被藏在御天敌的飞船里
that were hidden in the ship with Sentinel Prime.

842
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,350
它们都是某种汽车人科技的原型机
They're some kind of prototype Autobot technology.

843
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:44,850
他们说御天敌相当于汽车人的爱因斯坦
They say Sentinel was the Einstein of his civilization,

844
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,150
所以我们要锁好这些东西
so we're gonna keep these locked up

845
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,100
直到我们搞清它们的用处
until we know what we're dealing with.

846
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:51,480
现在任何人不得入内 任何人
Right now, no one gets access. No one.

847
00:47:51,950 --> 00:47:54,690
这个姓王的家伙认出了我 他让我来警告你们
This Wang guy recognized me. He told me to warn you.

848
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,990
他提到了月球的背面
He was talking about the dark side of the moon,

849
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,110
- 然后他们杀了他 - 等一下

850
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,240
- 你说月球？ - 是的 月球背面
- He mentioned the moon? - Yeah, dark side of the moon.

851
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:01,910
霸天虎为什么要暗杀人类？
But why would Decepticons want to kill humans?

852
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,040
我觉得他们的对手应该是汽车人
I thought their war was with the Autobots.

853
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:06,290
当时他做了头一份初期评定科学报告
And that is when he made his first quick-look science report.

854
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:08,040
那是我想要的…
That's what we want...

855
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,290
这小妞是谁？
Who's the chick? Okay.

856
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,340
打扰了 伦诺克斯上校
Excuse me! Colonel Lennox?

857
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:13,840
梅琳局长 这位是山姆·维特维奇…
Director Mearing, this is Sam Witwicky...

858
00:48:13,930 --> 00:48:15,600
我认识他 上校
I know his name, Colonel.

859
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:17,010
我想知道谁给了他许可？
I wanna know who gave him clearance?

860
00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,680
谁给了我许可？ 擎天柱行不行？
Who gave me clearance? How about Optimus Prime,

861
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:20,470
当时他跑到我们那里寻找我家
when he touched down in suburbia looking for my house?

862
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,880
这位是国家情报处局长
This is the National Intelligence Director.

863
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:24,180
如果你不知道的话…
In case you...

864

藐视联邦官员？
Disrespecting a federal officer?

865
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:28,810
这就够你受的了 她是谁？
Maybe that'll get you somewhere. Who's she?

866
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,110
她是我女友
She's my girlfriend.

867
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,770
这算什么 约会吗？
What is this, like, a date?

868
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:34,480
汽车人的事她全知道 她知道大黄蜂
She knows all about the Autobots, okay? She knows Bumblebee.

869
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:37,030
她来自一个军人家庭 我可以为她担保
And she comes from a military family. I can vouch for her.

870
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:39,780
好吧 我有主意了 我们还是谈谈正事吧？
Hey, I have an idea. How about we get back to the important topics,

871
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:42,240
比如 我今天差点就被一个霸天虎砍了头
like the fact that I almost had my face cut off by a Decepticon?

872
00:48:42,330 --> 00:48:44,910
做为一名纳税人 我想我可以抗议 事实上…
As a taxpayer, I'd like to lodge a complaint, as a matter of fact.

873
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,080
好吧 听着 好吗？
Okay, listen, all right?

874
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,200
山姆办公室的一名软件工程师今天被暗杀了
One of the software engineers at Sam's office was murdered today.

875
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,040
他参与过国家航空航天局的探月项目
He was involved in NASA's lunar mapping probe.

876
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:52,330
情况是这样 伦诺克斯上校
Here's the thing, Colonel Lennox.

877
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,460
我们不能把国家安全交付给这些年轻人
We cannot entrust national security to teenagers

878
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,100
除非我违反政策文件 能让这种事发生吗？
unless I missed a policy paper. Are we doing that now?

879
00:48:59,130 --> 00:49:00,390
不能 很好
No. Good.

880
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:01,930
我不在乎你是谁
I don't care who you are.

881
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,400
如果你敢泄露你所看到的一切
If you breathe a word of what you see in here,

882
00:49:04,410 --> 00:49:05,810
你将会因叛国罪而坐牢
you will do time for treason.

883
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:06,930
明白我的话吗？
Do you understand me?

884
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,390
我听从汽车人的命令 我认识他们 但不认识你
I'll take my orders from the Autobots. I know them. I don't know you.

885
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,560
你会认识的
You will.

886
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:16,030
御天敌
Sentinel Prime.

887
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,530
他靠能量生存 但现在没能量了
These things run on Energon, and he's out of it.

888
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,030
他现在处于休眠状态
He's in a sort of a sleep mode.

889
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,910
我们开始吧
Let us begin.

890
00:49:31,420 --> 00:49:33,580
这就是伟大的领导模块
That's the great Matrix of Leadership.

891
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
宇宙中只有它才能给变形金刚的火种补充能量
He holds the only thing in the universe that can repower a Transformer's spark.

892
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:41,380
难以置信
This is incredible.

893
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:43,720
御天敌
Sentinel Prime,

894
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:47,220
请你醒来吧
we bid you return.

895
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,760
（复仇）

896
00:49:57,070 --> 00:49:58,190
住手别开火！
Hold your fire!

897
00:49:58,280 --> 00:49:59,990
住手！御天敌！
Stop! Sentinel!

898
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,950
是我 擎天柱！
It is I, Optimus Prime!

899
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:06,900
一切都好 你很安全
It is all right. You are safe.

900
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,070
没什么可害怕的
There is nothing to fear.

901
00:50:11,210 --> 00:50:13,200
我们都在这里
We are here.

902
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,540
你到家了 御天敌
You are home, Sentinel.

903
00:50:21,260 --> 00:50:23,550
战争呢？ 战争！
The war... The war!

904
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,930
战争失败了
The war was lost.

905
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:29,390
塞伯坦成了不毛之地
Cybertron is now but a barren wasteland.

906
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,640
我们逃难到了地球
We have taken refuge here, on planet Earth.

907
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:35,270
这里的人类是我们的盟友
Its human race is our ally.

908
00:50:35,610 --> 00:50:38,350
我的飞船 我们冲破战火而来
My ship. We came under fire.

909
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:41,690
能量柱 能量柱在哪里？
The pillars. Where are the pillars?

910
00:50:42,370 --> 00:50:45,990
你救出了5根 包括主控柱
You saved five of them, including the control pillar.

911
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,370
只有5根？
Only five?

912
00:50:48,290 --> 00:50:49,870
我们曾经有数百根
We once had hundreds!

913
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,170
对不起 先生们
Excuse me, gentlemen.

914
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:54,040
我可以问一下 你们在开发的是什么技术？
May I ask, what is this technology you're looking for?

915
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:56,960
它具有重塑宇宙的能力
It is the ability to reshape the universe.

916
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:59,670
能量柱结合在一起就可以形成太空桥
Together the pillars form a space bridge.

917
00:50:59,970 --> 00:51:03,510
是我设计的 只有我一个人才能操作
I designed, and I alone, can control it.

918
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,550
它违背了你们的物理定律
It defies your laws of physics

919
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:08,260
能够超时空传送物质
to transport matter through time and space.

920
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:11,340
你们说的是一种远程传送装置 对吧？
You're talking about a teleportation device, aren't you?

921
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:14,230
是的 可以传送资源、难民
Yes, for resources, for refugees.

922
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:18,230
难民或者士兵 武器 甚至炸弹！
Refugees, or troops of soldiers, weapons, maybe bombs!

923
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:21,150
是种瞬时打击的手段！这就是它的军事用途 对吧？
A means of an instant strike! That's its military function, isn't it?

924
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,400
这是我们的技术 必须拿回来
It is our technology and it must be returned.

925
00:51:25,490 --> 00:51:27,910
对 得人类同意才行
Yes. If humans say so.

926
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,960
你们不能随便把大规模杀伤性武器带入我们的大气层！
You can't just bring weapons of mass destruction into our atmosphere!

927
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:33,450
至少要先申报海关！
You kind of have to clear customs first!

928
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,600
还要走一些官方手续
A little formality called paperwork

929
00:51:35,620 --> 00:51:37,030
这就是我们和动物之间的区别
kind of separates us from the animals.

930
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:40,590
你如果能够充分尊重我
I will overlook your condescending tone

931
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:43,290
我就原谅你的趾高气昂
if you heed the gravity of mine.

932
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,680
霸天虎不知道太空桥在这里
The Decepticons must never know the space bridge is here.

933
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:47,920
一旦太空桥落入他们手中
For in their hands,

934
00:51:48,390 --> 00:51:52,100
那就是你们的世界末日
it would mean the end of your world.

935
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,680
都是我的文件
"Total Nightmare" file.

936
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:56,600
调查行动开始了
So, the investigation is open.

937
00:51:56,870 --> 00:51:58,610
我们会派探员去你的办公室
We've sent agents to your office.

938
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:01,310
现在 我们打算派汽车人护送你们回家
And, for the time being, we're gonna send you home with Autobot protection.

939
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,560
我应该和谁谈
Who do I need to speak to

940
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:06,620
才能让你们明白我能帮上忙 能尽一份力呢？
to get you guys to understand that I can help, that I can contribute?

941
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:07,940
嘿 我们都能帮忙 你告诉我你知道的
Hey, we can all help. Want to tell you what I know?

942
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:10,700
我告诉你关于太阳系吧 那些好玩的星球晃来晃去
I could tell you about the solar system, all the fun planets to hang out in.

943
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:11,780
拜托从我桌子上下去
Get off my desk, please.

944
00:52:11,870 --> 00:52:14,580
你居然掏枪？现在我不想帮你了 她生气了
You pulling out guns? I can't help you out now. She angry.

945
00:52:14,670 --> 00:52:15,750
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

946
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,450
你们想要我干什么？让我回家去？
What do you envision for me? I go home now?

947
00:52:17,550 --> 00:52:19,540
回去工作吗？玩影印机是吗？
I go back to work? I make copies? I mean...

948
00:52:19,630 --> 00:52:21,870
这个组织的成员都是些资深的探员
This is a unit for veteran intelligence officers

949
00:52:21,970 --> 00:52:23,460
和特种部队
and Special Forces,

950
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,710
可不是有特殊汽车的男孩来的地方
not for boys who once owned special cars.

951
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,390
你有点刻薄了吧 女士？
That's a bit harsh, isn't it, ma'am?

952
00:52:27,510 --> 00:52:29,000
不要叫我「女士」 我不是「女士」
Don't call me ma'am. I'm not a ma'am.

953
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,590
你不是女的吗？
Well, you're a woman, aren't you?

954
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:33,930
那么 这些是你的？
So, are those yours?

955
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:35,980
是的 中情局发的
Yeah. CIA.

956
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:38,100
我之所以问是因为我也有奖章
I only ask 'cause I also have a medal,

957
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,460
总统发的
from the President.

958
00:52:39,610 --> 00:52:42,480
没错 好 那我就不兜圈子了 好吧？
Yeah. Great. So, it's not that complicated, right?

959
00:52:42,570 --> 00:52:45,150
没有我同意 谁都不能和汽车人合作
No one gets to work with the Autobots unless I approve it.

960
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:46,610
你破坏了我的指挥程序
You're breaking my chain of command.

961
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:51,660
好吧 我们走 你能做的都做了
Come on, let's go. You've done what you came for.

962
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,660
老实说 小伙子 我感谢你做的一切
With all due respect, young man, I appreciate what you did.

963
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,910
但你不是军人
But you're not a soldier.

964
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,740
你只是个送信的 永远都是
You're a messenger. You've always been a messenger.

965
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:00,620
他是个英雄
He's a hero.

966
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,180
大黄蜂 你去坐货运电梯 我们楼上见
Bee, you take the freight elevator. I'll see you up there.

967
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,600
这真是鬼扯 那个女人把我们踢出来了
This blows. That lady officially kicked us out.

968
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:19,430
没错 证人保护程序烂透了
Yeah. Witness Protection Program sucks.

969
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:22,610
说得不错 但有大黄蜂在至少我们更安全了
Yeah, but we're a whole lot safer with big yellow and his cannons.

970
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:24,530
那条狗可保护不了咱们
That dog can't protect crap.

971
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:27,150
大黄蜂
Bee?

972
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:34,790
你想出去？
You miss hanging out?

973
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,120
是啊 我也想
Yeah, me, too.

974
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,660
那个女人 她说我是个送信的
That woman, she called me a messenger.

975
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,370
你们能相信吗？忙了半天 我只是个送信的
Can you believe that? After everything I've done, I'm a messenger.

976
00:53:46,470 --> 00:53:49,210
哦 我相信你山姆 说实话我们也有同感
I believe it. I tell you, Sammy, we feel the same way.

977
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:51,010
这个星球上的人都不懂得尊重别人
The disrespect on this rock is criminal.

978
00:53:52,390 --> 00:53:55,220
我们应该做点什么
We should do something about it.

979
00:53:55,310 --> 00:53:59,470
大黄蜂 我要知道他们为什么追杀人类
Bee, I need to know why they're killing humans.

980
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,560
咱们得找个砖家问问
I say we call in the expert.

981
00:54:01,650 --> 00:54:04,440
下一位嘉宾是前美国情报人员
My next guest is a former American intelligence operative

982
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:06,390
他曾为我们爆出猛料
who has dared to speak out

983
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,200
关于我们国家宣称的军事同盟方是那些
regarding our alleged military alliance with what many describe

984
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,450
所谓的外星僱佣兵
as a group of extraterrestrial mercenaries.

985
00:54:13,540 --> 00:54:17,870
他就是畅销书《代号：英雄》的作者
He is the author of the bestselling book, Code-Name Hero.

986
00:54:18,250 --> 00:54:20,080
有请前探员 西摩·西蒙斯
Former special agent, Seymour Simmons.

987
00:54:20,170 --> 00:54:22,660
比尔 我是你的粉丝 很高兴接受专访
Bill. Big fan. Great to be here.

988
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,620
西蒙斯探员 你想让我们相信
Now, Agent Simmons, you would have us believe

989
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,460
对我们来说最要紧的事情
that it is in our best interest

990
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,130
就是在这场外星人内战中选好阵营吗？
to formally take sides in this so-called alien civil war?

991
00:54:30,220 --> 00:54:32,760
其中一派想把我们剁了做早餐吃
Well, the other side wanted to spank us for breakfast,

992
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,210
所以我们其实没什么选择余地
so I wouldn't exactly call it a toss-up.

993
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,100
那些霸天虎相当凶残
These Decepticons are lethal.

994
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:39,930
但民调显示世界上一半的人都认为更加安全
But polls show half the world would feel safer

995
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:41,760
假如汽车人离开地球的话
with the Autobots completely gone.

996
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:44,560
让他们滚出去！我们不需要他们！
Get them out of here! We don't need them here!

997
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,770
那为了安全 我只能抱着手榴弹睡觉了
I feel safer when I sleep with a hand grenade.

998
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:48,230
我这话未必对
Doesn't mean I'm always right.

999
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:51,030
探员先生 事实上我们得到的资料
Now, agent, here at The Factor we have obtained documents

1000
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,480
表明你已被开除…
that show you were fired....

1001
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,740
- 查斯 我在做访谈 - 抱歉 西蒙斯先生
- Chaz, I'm doing an interview. - Sorry, Mr. Simmons.

1002
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:56,940
机构裁员而已
Downsized, Bill.

1003
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:58,650
- 经费削减了 查斯 出去 - 这里是你的精神检验报告
- Budget cuts. Chaz, out. - Your psych evaluation reports

1004
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:01,460
上面说你有“严重的妄想倾向”
"severe delusional tendencies."

1005
00:55:01,540 --> 00:55:02,700
你这是搞突袭啊
This is ambush journalism.

1006
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,710
你想了解外星人联盟的真相吗？
You want the truth about the alien alliance?

1007
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:08,630
买我的书！来买我的书 不然就没有了 各位！
Buy my book! Buy my book, before it's too late, people!

1008
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:09,960
想跟我单挑是吧 比尔？
You want a piece of me, Bill?

1009
00:55:10,050 --> 00:55:11,420
想把我剥个精光？ 我恭候大驾！
You want to get naked? I'm ready!

1010
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:12,400
采访结束了！
Interview is over!.

1011
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:14,030
- 你 滚出我的房子！ - 你看起来就像个傻瓜
- You, out of my house. - You're sounding like a pinhead, agent

1012
00:55:14,470 --> 00:55:16,210
- 我给你个忠告吧  - 都结束了 懂不懂？
- And I've got a suggestion for you. - It's over. Understand?

1013
00:55:16,310 --> 00:55:17,510
- 赶快去看医生 - 达奇！
- Damage control. - Dutch!

1014
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:19,510
你们明显惹恼了西蒙斯先生！
You have obviously upset Mr. Simmons!

1015
00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:21,810
23秒之内你们必须离开这里
You have 23 seconds to leave the property.

1016
00:55:21,900 --> 00:55:23,310
我已经叫警察了！
I have called the police!

1017
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:25,890
你们这群乡巴佬真是自不量力！
You are peasant people throwing rocks at a giant!

1018
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,220
接下来呢？有什么安排？
What's up next? What have we got?

1019
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,650
签名售书 市中心 中午
Book signing, Midtown, noon.

1020
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:30,820
然后我们送你去参加发现频道的真人秀节目
Then we pitch your reality show to the Discovery Channel.

1021
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:34,110
还有那个维特维奇一直打电话找你
And I have this Witwicky who keeps calling me.

1022
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,240
今天已5次电话了
Five times today.

1023
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:36,490
那小子想干嘛？
Kid? What does he want?

1024
00:55:36,580 --> 00:55:38,030
我找你是因为霸天虎又回来了
I called you because the Decepticons are back.

1025
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,490
我想知道原因 我需要你的帮助
I want to know why, and I need your help.

1026
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,820
他们回来了？
They're back?

1027
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,330
那么这下又有钱赚了
Well, that's good for business.

1028
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:45,330
如果我告诉你我知道一个隐藏了50年的外星机密
What if I told you I know a 50-year-old alien secret

1029
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,630
从未有人对你说过的
that nobody ever told you.

1030
00:55:47,090 --> 00:55:49,800
求你别再引诱我
Do not tempt my addiction.

1031
00:55:49,890 --> 00:55:52,120
我已经金盆洗手了 孩子
I have gone through withdrawal, kid.

1032
00:55:52,220 --> 00:55:54,960
- 达奇 这条线路安全吗？ - 不
- Dutch, is this line secure? - No.

1033
00:55:57,470 --> 00:56:00,510
别冒险 我现在有钱了 我图什么啊？
Don't take the risk. I'm rich, why should I?

1034
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,970
不要再复出了 绝不能
Do not relapse. I won't.

1035
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,010
别让让心中的恶魔卷土重来
Do not let the demons win.

1036
00:56:06,110 --> 00:56:07,220
可以了
Got it.

1037
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,860
什么机密？
What kind of secret?

1038
00:56:11,410 --> 00:56:14,110
阿波罗 月亮 外星人 伪装…
Apollo. Moon. Aliens. Cover-up.

1039
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,320
未来技术 暗杀 这类的机密
Future tech. Assassinations. That kind of stuff.

1040
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:18,530
哦 阿波罗
Apollo.

1041
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:20,950
达奇！
Dutch!

1042
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:30,790
告诉威震天 哥重出江湖了
Tell Megatron, "Let's tango."

1043
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:44,840
这颗星球多么壮丽而祥和啊
So majestic and peaceful, this planet.

1044
00:56:45,400 --> 00:56:48,560
哪像塞伯坦的末日景象
Unlike the final days of Cybertron.

1045
00:56:48,650 --> 00:56:51,360
我曾经想过
I've wondered what might have been

1046
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:55,310
当初若是由您来指挥最后一战 而不是我
if you had fought the final battle, instead of me.

1047
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:58,530
别追悔过去 年轻的战士
Never mourn the past, young warrior.

1048
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:02,610
多亏了你 我们的种族才得以延续
Thanks to you, our race survives.

1049
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:07,080
您曾是我们的领袖 御天敌
You were our leader, Sentinel.

1050
00:57:07,170 --> 00:57:10,000
您有权再次领导我们
It is your right to lead us again.

1051
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:12,370
在这个我不熟悉的世界
In a world I do not know,

1052
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,430
我不再是你的师长了 擎天柱 你才是我的老师
I am no longer your teacher, Optimus. You are mine.

1053
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:23,640
这事得查个水落石出
You've got to break this case down.

1054
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:25,680
宇航员倒楣也能传染给我们
What we have here is an astronaut epidemic.

1055
00:57:25,770 --> 00:57:29,230
失踪 死亡 死于交通事故 谋杀 送医不治 车祸
MIA. Dead. Died in a car accident. Killed. DOA. Car death.

1056
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,430
像这群家伙不能驾驶
It's like these guys can't drive.

1057
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,560
他们连飞船都能开上天 居然开不好车
They can fly into outer space, but they can't drive a car.

1058
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,560
这是你要的情报 维特维奇
Procured your information, Witwicky.

1059
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,620
谢谢你 布鲁斯
Thank you, Bruce.

1060
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,860
慢着
Now,

1061
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,700
让我看一眼 就这一次
let me see one right now. One time.

1062
00:57:43,210 --> 00:57:44,320
- 要快 - 没问题
- Quick. - Very.

1063
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:51,990
探月轨道飞行器
Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.

1064
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,630
国航局于2009年发射
It says NASA launched it in 2009.

1065
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:57,300
看 庭审记录显示老王可能篡改了代码
See, forensics show Wang may have messed with the code,

1066
00:57:57,390 --> 00:57:58,970
导致无法测绘月球远端
preventing it from mapping the far side of the moon,

1067
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:00,290
也就是月球背面
which is also the dark side.

1068
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:01,800
太酷了
Fucking awesome.

1069
00:58:01,890 --> 00:58:03,700
他们搞渗透 搞恐吓
They infiltrate us, intimidate us,

1070
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,520
逼迫人类给他们干肮脏勾当
coerce us to do their dirty work.

1071
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:07,430
一旦事成后
And once they're done,

1072
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:10,270
就在脑袋上来两枪
a double-tap to the cerebellum.

1073
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,560
也就是说有人类在为霸天虎做事
So humans are working for the Decepticons.

1074
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,230
我觉得霸天虎不是
I don't think this is about the Decepticons

1075
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,730
在月球上找什么东西
looking for something on the moon.

1076
00:58:18,570 --> 00:58:22,030
我觉得他们是想要隐藏什么
I think it's about something they wanted to hide.

1077
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:24,150
跟老爸玩玩
Come to Daddy.

1078
00:58:25,290 --> 00:58:26,370
来吧 过两招
Come on, throw down.

1079
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,410
你小时候是不是脑袋让驴踢了？
Did you eat a lot of paint chips when you were a kid?

1080
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:32,040
真胡闹！
He's a freak.

1081
00:58:32,920 --> 00:58:34,380
- 喜欢吗？ - 回来！
- Like it?    - Get back!

1082
00:58:37,550 --> 00:58:38,760
我会教你！
I'm ticklish!

1083
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:44,340
先生！我在召开一个外星人情报高端分析会议
Sir! We are having a pretty high-level alien intel confab here

1084
00:58:44,430 --> 00:58:47,680
我想你没有资格参加 跟班小弟
that I don't think you're cleared for, errand boy.

1085
00:58:47,770 --> 00:58:48,800
对 你说得对
Yeah, you're right.

1086
00:58:48,900 --> 00:58:51,310
- 这机器人真给力  - 你该走了 布鲁斯
- It's a bitching robot. - I think it's time to go, Bruce.

1087
00:58:51,400 --> 00:58:53,940
- 多谢你让我开了眼界… - 走吧 布鲁斯
- Thank you so much for this. And... - Got to go, Bruce.

1088
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:57,500
我忙得浑身冒烟
I'm smoking over here.

1089
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,740
关于那些失踪的苏联宇航员
Downloading missing Russian cosmonauts.

1090
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:02,490
前苏联曾经取消了一次载人登月计划
Turns out the Soviets canceled a manned mission to the moon.

1091
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,450
那是1972年的事
The moon, in 1972.

1092
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,900
后来其中两个宇航员潜逃到了美国
And two of their cosmonauts went into hiding in America.

1093
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,700
我刚刚发现了他们
And I just found them alive.

1094
00:59:08,790 --> 00:59:10,000
你真是个天才 聪明鬼
You're a genius, Brains.

1095
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,340
看你干的好事 大黄蜂
That was smooth, Bumblebee.

1096
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,630
就差那么一点
Missed it by that much.

1097
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:26,800
嗨
Hi.

1098
00:59:27,390 --> 00:59:29,260
谁能告诉我这是怎么回事？
Would somebody care to tell me what the hell's going on?

1099
00:59:29,350 --> 00:59:31,430
- 你是谁？ - 你是谁？
- Who are you? - Who are you?

1100
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,060
居然问我？那个谁？达奇！搜她的身！
Who am I? Who is that? Dutch! Frisk her!

1101
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:35,560
遵命
Certainly.

1102
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,730
等等 达奇
No. Dutch.

1103
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:39,060
别碰我
Don't touch me.

1104
00:59:39,150 --> 00:59:40,690
- 我没打算碰  - 山姆？
- I'm not gonna touch her. - Sam?

1105
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,570
宝贝
Angel.

1106
00:59:43,950 --> 00:59:45,940
我在工作 很抱歉
I was working. I'm sorry about this.

1107
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,570
- 太好了 又要无家可归了 - 她住在这里？
- Great. We're homeless. - She lives here?

1108
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:50,870
你真该搜她身
You had your chance to frisk her.

1109
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,950
- 我有女友的 - 是吗？那她叫什么？
- I have a girlfriend. - Really? What's her name?

1110
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:55,200
印度
India.

1111
00:59:56,670 --> 00:59:58,630
我们要去参加迪伦的晚会 忘了吗？
We're supposed to be at Dylan's party, remember?

1112
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,170
我没忘 但这些人是我的朋友
I do remember, but these are my friends.

1113
01:00:00,260 --> 01:00:01,710
他们需要我 我现在走不开
They need me. I have to be here right now.

1114
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:05,090
那又怎样 汽车人和军方不能自己解决问题吗？
So, what, the Autobots and the military, they can't handle this on their own?

1115
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:07,420
知道我为什么喜欢你的战争故事吗？
You know what I liked about your war stories, Sam?

1116
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,600
因为它们仅仅是故事而已 都过去了
It's that they were stories, they were in the past.

1117
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,420
听着 我知道你又想起你牺牲的哥哥
Look, I know you're thinking about your brother, okay?

1118
01:00:11,520 --> 01:00:12,800
你在想你的家人
And you're thinking about your family.

1119
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:14,120
但现在情况不同
And it's not that situation.

1120
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,180
- 不同？ - 不同
- No?            - No.

1121
01:00:15,270 --> 01:00:18,020
有什么不同？为何怎么不同？
Why not? Why isn't it, Sam?

1122
01:00:18,110 --> 01:00:21,070
你觉得我们拿奖章好还是看到他活着好？
You think we'd rather have his medals, or we'd rather have him?

1123
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,000
你说得对 我明白了
I hear you. I get it.

1124
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:25,850
你要带我的幸运兔去哪？ 站住！
Where are you taking my bunny? Stop!

1125
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,410
求你先别走
Just stop for a second.

1126
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,950
我昨晚彻夜未眠
You think I could sleep last night?

1127
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,320
总算想明白了 山姆就是喜欢冒险
And then it hit me. No, Sam wants to be in danger.

1128
01:00:31,410 --> 01:00:34,000
- 不然他都不知道自己是谁了 - 我只想让你看得起我
- He doesn't know who he is without it. - I just want to matter.

1129
01:00:35,170 --> 01:00:36,780
我看得起你
You matter to me.

1130
01:00:43,050 --> 01:00:44,290
我知道你很担心 你非常担心我
I know you're worried. I know you're worried.

1131
01:00:44,390 --> 01:00:46,470
但我向你保证 我会照顾好自己
But I promise you, I can handle this.

1132
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,800
你能保证吗？
Can you? You can promise it?

1133
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:50,220
我保证
I promise.

1134
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:54,890
山姆 我不想失去你 我知道结果会怎样
Sam, I don't want to lose you, and I know where this leads.

1135
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,520
我还没心理准备
I'm not ready for this.

1136
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:02,650
你跟我一起去吗？
Are you coming with me?

1137
01:01:02,740 --> 01:01:04,150
抱歉
I can't.

1138
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:06,650
好吧
Okay.

1139
01:01:12,040 --> 01:01:13,490
嘿
Hey.

1140
01:01:17,670 --> 01:01:19,280
你的兔脚
Here's your foot.

1141
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,590
真正的勇士总是独来独往
The warrior's path is a solitary one.

1142
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,720
天啊 她怎么买得起那种车？
How the hell did she afford that car?

1143
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:38,180
- 老板送的 - 有钱的混蛋！
- Her boss. - Rich bastards!

1144
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:40,730
以前我也讨厌他们 现在嘛…
I used to hate them. Now, it's...

1145
01:01:42,610 --> 01:01:45,850
我们去黑帮追查两个前苏联宇航员
Going to a gig on the hunt for two Russian cosmonauts.

1146
01:01:45,950 --> 01:01:48,060
什么也比不上开迈巴赫拉风 是吧？
Nothing like driving in a Maybach.

1147
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:50,110
德国人造的车没得说
Germans know how to make cars, let me tell you.

1148
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:56,000
我的小达奇 原国家安全局的网络讯息高手
My Dutchman, former NSA cybersleuth extraordinaire,

1149
01:01:56,080 --> 01:01:57,320
他查到他们就在这里
tracked them down here.

1150
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:01,670
为什么这些宇航员要躲藏起来？为什么？
So, these cosmonauts went into hiding. Why?

1151
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,120
宾果 完全吻合
Bingo. I got a match.

1152
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:06,050
达奇 你真是头德国牧羊犬
You're a German Shepherd, Dutch.

1153
01:02:06,130 --> 01:02:09,380
俄国人有个毛病 就是不爱多说话
The thing about Russians is, they never like to talk.

1154
01:02:09,470 --> 01:02:12,210
我得用点“国际通用语”
It's gonna take a little of the "international language."

1155
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,700
（等会见）

1156
01:02:17,770 --> 01:02:19,640
那意思是“再见”
That means "good-bye."

1157
01:02:23,980 --> 01:02:24,820
来点带劲的

1158
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,270
没问题

1159
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:33,520
- 你真迷人 - 你嘴真甜

1160
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:35,070
别紧张
Stay loose.

1161
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:37,990
达奇 给我来句狠话
Dutch, give me something tough.

1162
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:41,990
巴雷什尼科夫
Baryshnikov.

1163
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:43,370
我们会说英语
We do speak English.

1164
01:02:43,670 --> 01:02:45,160
达奇 你真丢人
Dutch, you suck.

1165
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,250
这是古斯拉夫语
It's a Cyrillic alphabet.

1166
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:51,340
就像你在计算机上从不去按的那些生僻按键！
It's like all the buttons you never push on a calculator!

1167
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:53,720
我才不丢人呢
I don't suck.

1168
01:02:53,810 --> 01:02:56,920
我是西摩·西蒙斯特工 来自第八区 过去的第七区
Agent Seymour Simmons, Sector Eight, formerly Seven.

1169
01:02:57,020 --> 01:02:59,980
我们知道你们是谁 前苏联宇航员
We know who you are, cosmonautchiks.

1170
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:01,100
那又怎样？
So what?

1171
01:03:01,190 --> 01:03:04,150
你们本来要执行一次登陆月球背面的任务
You were supposed to travel to the dark side of the moon,

1172
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:06,940
但最终任务取消了
then it all got shut down.

1173
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:11,730
我们想知道为什么？
The question is, why?

1174
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:14,830
这三个人脑子有毛病吗？

1175
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,600
谁放他们进来的？

1176
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:18,730
“我的孩子能在这里抽烟吗？”
"Can my child smoke in here?"

1177
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:20,150
这些人我都不认识

1178
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,200
他们怎么进来的啊

1179
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:23,600
- 我怎么知道 - 叫保安来 快快！ 现在就叫

1180
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,640
愣着干嘛！

1181
01:03:26,630 --> 01:03:27,840
好 没问题 好
Okay, all right. Okay.

1182
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,130
来啊 开枪啊
Go ahead, shoot me.

1183
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:31,770
你来这里想干什么？

1184
01:03:31,890 --> 01:03:33,630
我可以为国捐躯 你行吗？
I'm willing to die for my country. Are you?

1185
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,000
你给我闭嘴 老实滚出去

1186
01:03:35,020 --> 01:03:36,130
真的吗？
Really?

1187
01:03:36,890 --> 01:03:38,880
你真美 有人说过你很美吗？
You are beautiful. Has anyone ever told you you're beautiful?

1188
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,140
她是位美丽的女人
She's a beautiful woman.

1189
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,230
达奇！给我乖一点
Dutch! Back in the cage.

1190
01:03:52,410 --> 01:03:54,360
达奇！住手 达奇 住手！
Dutch! Hold, Dutch, hold!

1191
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,320
管好你的人 别让他乱来！
Control your boy, please. Control your boy.

1192
01:03:56,410 --> 01:03:57,570
达奇 住手！
Dutch, stop!

1193
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,370
真抱歉 刚才是过去的我
I'm so sorry. That is the old me.

1194
01:04:05,460 --> 01:04:07,200
好了 大家都冷静下来！
Okay, let's everybody just calm down!

1195
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:09,500
让我们都把枪放下 放轻松
Let's lower the heat, lower the guns. Let's relax.

1196
01:04:09,580 --> 01:04:11,080
二战已经结束了
World War II is over.

1197
01:04:13,850 --> 01:04:17,260
你们即将看到前苏联最重要的机密之一
You are about to see one of the biggest Soviet secrets.

1198
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:21,180
美国第一个把人类送上了月球
America first to send man to the moon.

1199
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,930
但苏联却是抢先把照相机送了上去
But USSR first to send camera.

1200
01:04:24,770 --> 01:04:27,810
1959年 我们的月球3号
In 1959, our Luna 3

1201
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:31,140
拍摄了月球背面的照片
take picture of the dark, the shadow side.

1202
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:33,610
空无一物
Sees nothing.

1203
01:04:34,780 --> 01:04:38,280
但到了1963年 月球4号发现了…
But in 1963, Luna 4 sees...

1204
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:40,490
- 奇怪的石堆 - 对
- Strange rocks. - Yeah.

1205
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:43,620
就在飞船周围 有好几百块
Around the ship. Hundreds of them.

1206
01:04:43,710 --> 01:04:45,450
给他们看照片
Yeah, show picture.

1207
01:04:46,290 --> 01:04:49,210
还有些拖拽的痕迹
With some drag marks.

1208
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:55,290
我见过这个 这些不是石头 是能量柱
I've seen these. These aren't rocks, these are pillars.

1209
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,010
用来建造太空桥的能量柱
Alien pillars for a space bridge.

1210
01:04:58,100 --> 01:05:00,340
我们知道这些 是因为汽车人手里有五根
We know about them because the Autobots have five of these.

1211
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:04,550
霸天虎一定是在阿波罗11号抵达之前就突袭过飞船
The Decepticons must have raided the ship before Apollo 11 ever got there,

1212
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,060
拿走了能量柱 并将之藏了起来
took the pillars, and hid them.

1213
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:08,180
但这不合逻辑
It doesn't make sense.

1214
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:10,270
霸天虎找到了飞船 也拿走了全部能量柱
The Decepticons have the ship. They have all those pillars.

1215
01:05:10,360 --> 01:05:11,440
那为什么偏偏留下了御天敌呢？
Why would they leave Sentinel

1216
01:05:11,530 --> 01:05:13,360
他可是唯一会使用能量柱的
when he's the only one who can use them?

1217
01:05:13,910 --> 01:05:15,240
除非…
Unless...

1218
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,570
他就是霸天虎仍然觊觎的目标
He's the one thing they still need.

1219
01:05:18,030 --> 01:05:19,400
我们得赶紧去找御天敌
We've got to meet up with Sentinel,

1220
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:20,950
守在他身旁 保卫他的安全
rendezvous with him and keep him safe.

1221
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:23,570
梅琳 我刚刚找到御天敌 擎天柱10分钟后就到
Mearing, I just picked up Sentinel. Optimus is 10 minutes behind.

1222
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:24,780
我们正在返回NEST
We're coming to NEST now.

1223
01:05:27,290 --> 01:05:29,030
维特维奇先生 我记得提醒过你
Mr. Witwicky, I thought I made it clear to you

1224
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:30,620
不要再打这个电话了
that I did not want you calling this phone.

1225
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,420
听着 整件事都是个陷阱
Listen, the whole thing has been a setup since the beginning.

1226
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:35,620
霸天虎希望擎天柱找到御天敌
The Decepticons wanted Optimus to find Sentinel

1227
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:37,420
因为只有擎天柱才能复活他
because only Optimus could revive him.

1228
01:05:37,510 --> 01:05:39,250
但太空桥在我们手中
But we have the space bridge.

1229
01:05:39,350 --> 01:05:41,000
梅琳 你手中只有5个能量柱
Mearing, you have five pillars.

1230
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,640
我刚刚得知霸天虎有几百个
I just learned that they have hundreds.

1231
01:05:42,680 --> 01:05:43,970
你是在被他们牵着鼻子走
You're doing exactly what they wanted you to do.

1232
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:45,270
我要跟你说的是
What do you need me to say to you?

1233
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:47,840
霸天虎很快就会来找御天敌
The Decepticons are coming for Sentinel Prime!

1234
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:49,100
我们马上出发去NEST
We're going to NEST.

1235
01:05:53,990 --> 01:05:55,400
能量警报！
We have an Energon alert.

1236
01:05:55,490 --> 01:05:57,850
在华盛顿州际公路上发现能量讯号…
Energon readings detected on the D. C. Parkway.

1237
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,870
正在追踪三辆黑色越野车
Currently tracking three black Suburbans.

1238
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:38,610
大黄蜂 你掩护御天敌离开这里
Bee, you got to get Sentinel out of here! You got to guard him!

1239
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:49,910
噢 天啊 我要被炒鱿鱼了
Oh, mein Gott! I'm fired!

1240
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,670
当心！ 当心！ 当心！
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

1241
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,260
抓住你了
Got you!

1242
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:17,400
射击！射击！打死他 大黄蜂！
Shoot him! Shoot him! Shoot him, Bee!

1243
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:47,890
大黄蜂 再开快点！再快 快！
Bee, you've got to move faster! Faster, Bee! Go!

1244
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:52,720
大黄蜂！
Bee!

1245
01:08:14,840 --> 01:08:15,950
好了 回NEST去！
All right, back to NEST!

1246
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:24,920
恐龙 我来对付他！
Dino, I got him!

1247
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:34,970
铁皮！
Ironhide!

1248
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,340
有什么问题吗？
Is there a problem?

1249
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:04,880
哇哦 搞得跟西部片对决一样
A little Mexican standoff we got here.

1250
01:09:05,350 --> 01:09:06,800
放下武器
Weapons down.

1251
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,930
我们会让你们体面地离开
And we'll let you escape with your dignity.

1252
01:09:14,230 --> 01:09:15,510
丢掉武器
Drop them.

1253
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:18,810
很好
That's good.

1254
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:24,520
铁皮 当心！
Ironhide, watch out!

1255
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:31,730
铁皮 接枪！
Ironhide, catch!

1256
01:09:37,420 --> 01:09:38,780
当心背后
Behind you!

1257
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:44,170
霸天虎小混混
Decepticon punk!

1258
01:09:52,310 --> 01:09:53,920
管教完毕
Class dismissed.

1259
01:09:59,770 --> 01:10:02,560
- 都进去！走吧！ - 快点！动作快！
- Get inside! Let's go! - Move! Keep moving!

1260
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:04,860
- 伦诺克斯！ - 快 快 快！
- Lennox!        - Go, go, go!

1261
01:10:04,950 --> 01:10:06,060
到处都是霸天虎
We got Decepticons everywhere.

1262
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:08,240
我已经派出全部人马去搜捕他们了 铁皮！
I've got my whole team deployed looking for them. Ironhide!

1263
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:10,860
保护御天敌！带他到里面去！
Protect Sentinel! Get him locked up inside!

1264
01:10:10,950 --> 01:10:12,190
包在我身上
Consider it done!

1265
01:10:12,290 --> 01:10:14,570
你要保卫好他 他是整件事的关键
Hey, you've got to guard him, 'cause he's the key to the whole thing.

1266
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:19,410
说得没错 你们必须意识到 汽车人兄弟们
Indeed, I am. What you must realize, my Autobot brothers,

1267
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,120
我们当年根本赢不了那场战争
is we were never going to win the war.

1268
01:10:22,670 --> 01:10:24,880
为了保存住我们的母星
For the sake of our planet's survival,

1269
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:27,090
我不得不和威震天做了笔交易
a deal had to be made with Megatron.

1270
01:10:36,390 --> 01:10:39,310
- 退后！ - 你这是干什么？
- Get back! - What have you done?

1271
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,690
我马上就让你解脱
I hereby discharge you from duty.

1272
01:10:49,780 --> 01:10:50,940
- 大黄蜂！ - 退后！
- Bee!      - Get back!

1273
01:11:06,130 --> 01:11:08,750
NEST全部人马撤回基地！快点！
Rally all NEST forces back to the base! Come on!

1274
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:09,830
不…
No...

1275
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:19,640
叫个医疗兵来！
Get a medic down here!

1276
01:11:19,730 --> 01:11:23,220
我们人手不足！不要和御天敌交战！
We don't have enough men! Do not engage Sentinel!

1277
01:11:23,610 --> 01:11:24,850
我们走后门
Just go to the back gate.

1278
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:31,690
卧倒！
Tak e cover!

1279
01:11:35,240 --> 01:11:36,480
注意左边！注意左边！
Watch left! Watch left!

1280
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,690
快点！跟我来！
Let's go! Follow me!

1281
01:11:48,170 --> 01:11:50,090
- 局长 别去那儿！ - 退后！
- Director, don't go there! - Stand down!

1282
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:51,260
嘿 御天敌！
Hey, Sentinel!

1283
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,050
- 局长！ - 出什么事了？
- Director! - What is going on?

1284
01:11:53,140 --> 01:11:54,420
你这是在干什么？
What do you think you are doing?

1285
01:11:57,730 --> 01:11:59,720
我是首领！
I am a Prime!

1286
01:11:59,810 --> 01:12:02,180
不会听命于你
I do not take orders from you.

1287
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,600
梅琳局长 拜托
Director Mearing, come on.

1288
01:12:04,690 --> 01:12:06,480
我们打不过他 走吧 我们必须离开
We can't fight him. Let's go. We have to go.

1289
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,030
现在把我的东西还给我！
Now return what belongs to me!

1290
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,560
哦 我的天啊！
Oh, my God!

1291
01:12:27,630 --> 01:12:29,960
- 你们还好吗？ - 大家都出去了？
- You guys okay? - Is everybody out?

1292
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:32,340
各位 保持镇静 你们会没事的
Everybody, stay calm. You're gonna be fine.

1293
01:12:41,850 --> 01:12:45,100
你看看 擎天柱！这都是你的错！
Yeah, take a look, Optimus! This is all on you!

1294
01:12:45,190 --> 01:12:47,180
御天敌破坏了仓库！抢走了能量柱
Sentinel hit the vault! Took the pillars.

1295
01:12:48,780 --> 01:12:52,520
快 我们走 通知101空降师！
Come on, let's go. All right, notify the 101St Airborne!

1296
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:54,950
我们得抓住那个家伙！
We need to hunt this thing down!

1297
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:02,280
卡莉！
Carly!

1298
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:07,280
这么一小堆篝火还挺热的
Hot from our little campfire.

1299
01:13:07,630 --> 01:13:09,410
夹心巧克力饼 多美妙啊
S'mores. Isn't that great?

1300
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,340
简直是在世外桃源
We're really living off the land.

1301
01:13:12,220 --> 01:13:14,210
妈 爸 你们见到卡莉回家了吗？
Mom, Dad, have you guys seen Carly come home yet?

1302
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:16,460
我说 你就不会敲门吗？这是我们的卧室
Excuse me. Can you knock, please? This is our bedroom.

1303
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:17,670
她难道会不回家吗？
Why wouldn't she be at home?

1304
01:13:17,850 --> 01:13:20,760
我们吵架了或许分手了
We had a fight and we might have broken up,

1305
01:13:20,850 --> 01:13:21,930
也可能只是暂时分开 我不太清楚
or be on a break. I don't really know.

1306
01:13:22,020 --> 01:13:24,230
- 什么？不  - 我不想谈这事
- What? No. - Look, I can't talk about it right now.

1307
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:26,550
妈 我不想谈细节 我必须找到她
I can't go into details, Mom. I have to find her.

1308
01:13:26,650 --> 01:13:29,610
坐下 我们开个家庭会议！家庭会议！
Sit down. We're having a family meeting. Family meeting!

1309
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:30,890
也许你不知道
You may not know this,

1310
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:33,400
其实你爸和我也不是一直这么恩爱
but your father and I were not always this perfectly happy.

1311
01:13:33,490 --> 01:13:34,900
结婚这些年来有一段时期
You know, there was a time in our marriage

1312
01:13:34,990 --> 01:13:36,650
我认为没法再继续下去了
when I thought this was not gonna work out.

1313
01:13:36,910 --> 01:13:38,690
- 能别说这个吗？ - 她伤害了他
- Can we please not? - She's damaging him.

1314
01:13:38,910 --> 01:13:41,370
你和一个世界级美人儿分手…
You break up with one world-class hottie...

1315
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,940
不 别说了 停下 好吗？她甩了我
No. Stop. Stop, okay? She dumped me,

1316
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:45,030
我再去找个更好的 不就行了吗 我还更幸福呢
I moved on to something better. That's it. I'm a happier person.

1317
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:46,110
这是第二个漂亮姑娘了 你又让她跑了
The second beautiful girl, and you lose her.

1318
01:13:46,210 --> 01:13:47,200
为何你不帮我一把呢？
Why don't you help me?

1319
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,620
- 他们只是发生争执 - 只是吵架
- They had an argument. - One fight.

1320
01:13:49,710 --> 01:13:52,580
你很难再找到第三个了 我是说 除非你那个很大…
You're not gonna get a third one, I mean, unless you have like a big...

1321
01:13:52,670 --> 01:13:53,910
我晕 老妈！
What the... Ma!

1322
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:56,420
你大概都不知道自己在干什么
Maybe you just don't know what you're doing.

1323
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,590
- 我不想再说了 - 你需要这本书
- I don't want to talk about this anymore. - You need the book.

1324
01:13:58,680 --> 01:14:00,720
- 跟他说说这本书 - 男人永远是错的 慢慢习惯吧
- Tell him about the book. - You're always wrong. Get used to it.

1325
01:14:00,810 --> 01:14:02,590
好吧 你应该读一读 《女人至上》
Okay. You've gotta read this. She Comes First.

1326
01:14:02,680 --> 01:14:04,720
- 这里头有些很有用的知识 - 不 不
- There's some killer shit in here. - No. No.

1327
01:14:04,810 --> 01:14:07,270
- 就这样 来吧 - 不！不！
- That's it, I'm going. - No! No!

1328
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:09,930
坐下 坐下！帮帮我！
Sit down, sit down! Back me up!

1329
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:12,730
- 老婆开心 生活舒心 - 没错
- Happy wife, happy life. - Heck yeah.

1330
01:14:12,820 --> 01:14:16,280
老婆不满 余生冰冷如石一般悲惨…
Unhappy wife, stone-cold misery for the rest of your...

1331
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:17,600
- 闭嘴 - 是实话
- Stop. - It's true.

1332
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:19,860
我想说的是 你爱这女孩吗？
All I'm saying is, do you love this girl?

1333
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:22,530
- 这辈子就认她了 - 那就去把她追回来
- She's the one. - Then you gotta go get her.

1334
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,910
告诉你 你爸和我吵架的时候
I mean, your dad and I, when we had troubles,

1335
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:27,660
他会上天入地去找我
he moved heaven and earth to find me.

1336
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,330
告诉他你怎么说的 说嘛
Say what you said. Say it.

1337
01:14:30,420 --> 01:14:33,040
“我会陪你直到地老天荒”
"I will follow you to the end of time."

1338
01:14:33,550 --> 01:14:34,630
听起来很傻吧？
Does that suck or what?

1339
01:14:34,720 --> 01:14:36,630
- 就像狗屎科幻电影一样 - 不 很浪漫啊
- It's like a bad sci-fi film. - No. It is so sweet.

1340
01:14:37,430 --> 01:14:40,090
你们得离开这个城市 走得越远越好
I want you to get out of the city. You get as far away from here as you can.

1341
01:14:40,430 --> 01:14:41,420
明白吗？
You understand?

1342
01:14:41,760 --> 01:14:42,750
我爱你们
I love you.

1343
01:15:02,990 --> 01:15:06,360
主人！多么完美的计划！
My master! Such a brilliant scheme!

1344
01:15:06,460 --> 01:15:10,620
原来御天敌离开塞伯坦时 就已经是叛徒了？
So when Sentinel left Cybertron, it was to defect?

1345
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:14,410
他本该和我在地球会合
He was meant to rendezvous with me here on Earth

1346
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,750
谁知命运使我们擦肩而过
before fate waylaid us both.

1347
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,630
复活他的唯一途径
The only way to revive him,

1348
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:22,590
就是擎天柱和他的领导模块
we needed Prime and his Matrix.

1349
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:24,750
高明的策略
Excellent strategy.

1350
01:15:33,940 --> 01:15:35,810
我的 我的！
Mine, mine!

1351
01:15:37,030 --> 01:15:39,770
他现在是您的伙伴了 主人？
So he is now your partner, master?

1352
01:15:39,990 --> 01:15:43,450
他是我最伟大的战利品
He is my greatest triumph.

1353
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:44,820
我对您五体投地
So impressive.

1354
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:47,400
开始传输
Commencing transport.

1355
01:15:47,540 --> 01:15:50,330
住手！不！不 御天敌！
Stop! No! No, Sentinel!

1356
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,870
原谅我
Forgive me.

1357
01:15:55,880 --> 01:15:57,840
我们来了
Here we are.

1358
01:15:57,920 --> 01:15:59,790
和我们战斗吧
Fight us now.

1359
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,960
小心！快走！快走！
Watch out! Move it! Move it!

1360
01:16:45,180 --> 01:16:47,340
汽车人 撤退！
Autobots, retreat!

1361
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,040
为什么 御天敌 为什么？
Why, Sentinel, why?

1362
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,160
为了塞伯坦！为了我们的家园！
For Cybertron! For our home!

1363
01:17:19,630 --> 01:17:22,100
战争的破坏我们可以修复！
What war destroyed, we can rebuild!

1364
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,090
但必须和霸天虎合作
But only if we join with the Decepticons.

1365
01:17:25,190 --> 01:17:26,780
不 还有别的方法
No, it's not the only way.

1366
01:17:26,780 --> 01:17:28,380
这里才是我们的家！
This is our home!

1367
01:17:28,380 --> 01:17:29,970
我们必须保护人类！
We must defend the humans!

1368
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,420
你误入歧途了 擎天柱
So lost you are, Optimus.

1369
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:34,550
在塞伯坦 我们被敬若神明
On Cybertron, we were gods.

1370
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:38,140
这里 地球人叫我们机器
And here, they call us machines.

1371
01:17:38,230 --> 01:17:41,940
让人类成为我们的奴仆 否则就灭亡
Let the humans serve us, or perish.

1372
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:49,240
我没杀你算你走运 将来你会明白的
You're lucky I didn't kill you. In time you'll see.

1373
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,400
这还不算完
It's not over.

1374
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:59,250
如果我是他 我一秒钟都不会让你离开我的视线
Now, if I were him, I wouldn't let you out of my sight for one second.

1375
01:18:01,670 --> 01:18:03,410
有意思 来这的路上我一直琢磨
It's funny. I was just thinking on the way over here,

1376
01:18:03,510 --> 01:18:05,540
我真的需要迪伦给点建议 而他就在这里
I could really use some advice from Dylan, and there he is.

1377
01:18:05,630 --> 01:18:07,170
- 能跟你谈谈吗 卡莉？ - 欢迎 请坐
- Can I speak to you, Carly? - Welcome. Please, sit down.

1378
01:18:07,260 --> 01:18:08,380
喝杯酒吧
Have a drink.

1379
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:11,720
老实说 我不想喝酒 也不在乎车子或工作
You know what, I don't need a drink. Or a car, or a job.

1380
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,220
我就想和我女友单独谈谈
I just need to speak to my girlfriend alone.

1381
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:14,590
你不会介意吧 电灯泡先生？
Is that okay with you, Mr. Inappropriate?

1382
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,100
不好意思
Excuse me.

1383
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,150
- 出什么事了？ - 到外面再说
- What's going on? - I'll tell you outside.

1384
01:18:23,780 --> 01:18:25,440
我认为我能帮你 山姆
I really think I can help you, Sam.

1385
01:18:25,530 --> 01:18:28,110
我曾和父亲探讨如何做出抉择
I remember a talk I had with my dad once about tough choices.

1386
01:18:28,200 --> 01:18:30,030
可惜现在不是时候 咱们回头再聊
Yeah, now's not the time. We'll set something up, though.

1387
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,360
当然那是很久以前了 那时我父亲的公司还在…
Of course, it was way back, when my dad's firm was in charge

1388
01:18:32,450 --> 01:18:35,160
为国家航空航天局做经费预算和财务报表
of budget review and accounting for NASA.

1389
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,870
他教给我的是…
You see, the thing that he taught me was,

1390
01:18:37,960 --> 01:18:39,200
如果这战争与你无关
when it's not your war,

1391
01:18:39,290 --> 01:18:41,300
那就最好站在能赢的那方
you join the side that's going to win.

1392
01:18:43,090 --> 01:18:44,080
走
Move.

1393
01:18:44,170 --> 01:18:45,630
太直接了？我的老毛病？
Too direct? Or is it just me?

1394
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,750
一点也不
Certainly not you, sir.

1395
01:19:00,610 --> 01:19:01,850
你是我的了！
You're mine!

1396
01:19:02,610 --> 01:19:03,640
不！
No!

1397
01:19:06,780 --> 01:19:08,610
- 来人啊！ - 山姆 我无法出来！
- Get help! - Sam, I can't get out!

1398
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:10,150
- 谁来救救她！ - 晚安！
- Someone get help! - Good night!

1399
01:19:10,240 --> 01:19:11,280
晚安 迪伦先生
Good night, Mr. Dylan.

1400
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,360
山姆 救我出去！
Get me out of here!

1401
01:19:16,750 --> 01:19:19,080
救命！救救她！
Help! Get help!

1402
01:19:19,170 --> 01:19:22,160
- 他还年轻 还要深造 晚安 - 救我出去！
- He's young. He will learn. Good night. - Get me out!

1403
01:19:22,290 --> 01:19:23,500
今晚很愉快
It was a fun night.

1404
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:26,150
你真的以为自己是第一个
You really think you're the first man

1405
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:28,290
涉足外星人事务的人吗？
ever asked to join the noble alien cause?

1406
01:19:28,380 --> 01:19:29,720
你到底是谁？
Who are you?

1407
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,890
你知道为什么1972年之后我们再也没有登月吗？
Do you know why we've not been back to the moon since 1972?

1408
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,800
因为这两位
Because these two,

1409
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:37,930
他们来找我父亲 要求他伪造一些账目
they came to my dad and they told him to do some creative accounting.

1410
01:19:38,020 --> 01:19:40,100
拼命拔高预算而无法再次登月
Make it way too expensive to ever go back.

1411
01:19:40,100 --> 01:19:43,020
因此他和其它人终止了美苏两国的太空计划
So, he and the others shut down the American and Russian space programs.

1412
01:19:43,110 --> 01:19:45,100
自此这二位便成为了我们的客户
And they've been our clients ever since.

1413
01:19:45,190 --> 01:19:46,520
你帮他们杀人？
You think they'd give you a choice?

1414
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,850
你以为我有得选择吗？
You think they'd give you a choice?

1415
01:19:47,990 --> 01:19:49,650
再说 我个人也没有参与
Besides, it's not like I personally participated.

1416
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,770
我只是个联络人 只负责传话
I am a liaison. I liaise.

1417
01:19:55,370 --> 01:19:56,700
该是坏人出场的时候了 山姆
It's hostile takeover time, Sam.

1418
01:19:59,290 --> 01:20:00,530
山姆！
Sam!

1419
01:20:03,500 --> 01:20:05,580
- 山姆！ - 放她走！
- Sam! - Let her go!

1420
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:07,830
山姆！
Sam!

1421
01:20:10,880 --> 01:20:12,880
我监视你很多年了 山姆
I've had my eye on you for years, Sam.

1422
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,010
我一直无法在汽车人身边安插间谍
You're the one spy I've never been able to provide

1423
01:20:15,100 --> 01:20:16,550
而某人却可以轻易做到
as someone close to the Autobots.

1424
01:20:20,060 --> 01:20:22,220
山姆 别照他说的做！
Sam! Don't do what he wants!

1425
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:23,930
他会的
Yes, he will.

1426
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,060
他们都会
They all do.

1427
01:20:27,820 --> 01:20:29,560
他们会杀了她 你懂吗？
They will slaughter her, you understand me?

1428
01:20:29,650 --> 01:20:33,190
只要一眨眼的功夫 他们就会杀了她 然后杀了我
In the time it takes you to blink, they'll do it to her and they'll do it to me.

1429
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,070
所以 你至少该尊重下
So you show a little respect

1430
01:20:35,160 --> 01:20:37,400
那个给你推荐工作的人！
when someone offers you a job!

1431
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,030
手腕
Wrist.

1432
01:20:40,710 --> 01:20:42,290
你要去找擎天柱
You are to track down Optimus Prime,

1433
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,240
因为在人类中他最信任你
because you're the one human he trusts,

1434
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,870
你要问他一个问题
and you will ask one question.

1435
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,400
他打算如何反击？
How does he intend to fight back?

1436
01:20:47,470 --> 01:20:50,180
什么策略 什么战术 全都给我套出来！
Strategies, tactics, everything!

1437
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:58,180
咬得够狠吧 对不对？这可是高科技
Has a nasty little bite, doesn't it? It's very high-tech.

1438
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,800
它能让我们看你所看 听你所听
It lets us see what you see, hear what you hear

1439
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:02,220
还能介入你的神经系统
and it taps your nervous system.

1440
01:21:02,310 --> 01:21:04,680
所以你不要妄想警告其他人…
So, if you so much as try and signal...

1441
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:08,610
我要告诉你 山姆
I don't know what to tell you, Sam.

1442
01:21:08,690 --> 01:21:11,730
人际关系决定命运 我站在这儿是因为我父亲
Relationships have consequences. I am here because of my father.

1443
01:21:11,820 --> 01:21:13,230
她待在这儿是因为你
She is here because of you.

1444
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,120
住手 住手 住手 住手！
Stop, stop! Stop! Stop!

1445
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:19,980
声波 收敛点行吗？
Soundwave, would you please?

1446
01:21:24,380 --> 01:21:26,210
山姆 你乖乖办事
Sam, do your job.

1447
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:29,120
她会没事的 我向你保证
She'll be safe. I give you my word.

1448
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:34,460
我会杀了你 我也向你保证
I'll kill you. You have my word.

1449
01:21:37,300 --> 01:21:40,470
指挥中心已发布一级战备状态
Combatant Commands are now at DEFCON 1.

1450
01:21:40,770 --> 01:21:43,300
世界各地潜伏着大约两百个霸天虎
Approximately 200 Decepticons are now in hiding.

1451
01:21:43,770 --> 01:21:45,260
检测到超能量的存在
Energon detectors have been triggered

1452
01:21:45,350 --> 01:21:47,520
甚至远至南美和中国
as far away as South America and China.

1453
01:21:47,900 --> 01:21:50,640
联合国刚刚收到一份加密音频文件
The U. N. Just received an encrypted audio file.

1454
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:53,480
是来自汽车人的领袖
They say it's from the leader of the Autobots.

1455
01:21:53,570 --> 01:21:55,150
地球的保卫者们
Defenders of Earth.

1456
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,900
我们来到这里寻求自然资源
We have come for your natural resources

1457
01:21:57,990 --> 01:22:00,110
以重建我们满目疮痍的母星
to rebuild our damaged planet.

1458
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,160
我们的所有要求得到满足后
When we have transported all we need,

1459
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:06,280
就会和平地离开地球
we will leave your world in peace.

1460
01:22:06,380 --> 01:22:08,290
为了保证这份和平
For such peace to exist,

1461
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:13,120
你们必须立即驱逐已收留的汽车人叛逆
you must immediately exile the Autobot rebels you have harbored.

1462
01:22:14,010 --> 01:22:15,500
没有谈判的余地
Nonnegotiable.

1463
01:22:16,010 --> 01:22:17,500
立即驱逐那些叛逆
Renounce the rebels.

1464
01:22:18,050 --> 01:22:20,470
我们等候你们的答覆
We await your reply.

1465
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:22,760
我们会跟进你的情报
We'll debrief you in transit.

1466
01:22:22,850 --> 01:22:24,260
我不知道能帮什么忙
Yeah, I really don't see how I can be of any help.

1467
01:22:24,350 --> 01:22:25,430
再说你们也挺忙的
I mean, you guys seem pretty busy.

1468
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:27,350
我们可以下次再谈
We could just do this another time, I think.

1469
01:22:30,860 --> 01:22:33,020
看来我过去真是低估了你了
I have underestimated you at every turn.

1470
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,350
啊… 什么？
What?

1471
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,280
你提醒过我们 他们在利用人类
You warned us that they were using humans.

1472
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,020
也说过御天敌是全局的关键
And you knew that Sentinel was the key.

1473
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,320
局长！
Director!

1474
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:43,030
我算啥啊？你们才是专家 我只是个会泄露机密的家伙
Who am I? Hey, you're the expert. I'm just a walking security risk.

1475
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:50,410
你没事吧？
Are you all right?

1476
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:53,490
没事
Yes.

1477
01:22:53,800 --> 01:22:55,960
- 不对 你出了很多汗 - 我没事 我没事
- No, you're not. You're sweating. - I'm fine. I'm fine.

1478
01:22:56,050 --> 01:22:57,160
我出汗是因为我紧张
I'm sweating because I'm nervous.

1479
01:22:57,260 --> 01:22:59,340
我紧张是因为你把这些讯息告诉给我
I'm nervous because you got me in here with this information.

1480
01:22:59,430 --> 01:23:00,710
好吧 我用推特上瘾了 我博客上什么都写
Okay, I'm a Twitter junkie. I blog everything.

1481
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:02,540
- 我不能保守秘密来保命 - 你不敢的
- I can't keep a secret to save my life. - You wouldn't dare.

1482
01:23:02,640 --> 01:23:04,010
是真的 我不骗你
That's the truth. I'm telling you.

1483
01:23:04,010 --> 01:23:05,380
局长 15号线有五角大楼的电话
Director, the Pentagon's calling in 15.

1484
01:23:07,230 --> 01:23:08,720
- 你在干什么？ - 没什么 你在干什么？
- What are you doing? - Nothing. What are you doing?

1485
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:11,480
离我远点
Get away from me.

1486
01:23:11,570 --> 01:23:14,400
今天在国会发生的事件具有重大意义
It's been a remarkable series of events today at the Capitol.

1487
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:16,520
就在不久之前 国会通过法案
Just moments ago, legislation was passed

1488
01:23:16,610 --> 01:23:18,070
决定将汽车人驱逐出
to exile the Autobots

1489
01:23:18,160 --> 01:23:19,490
美国领土
from American shores.

1490
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:22,860
美军与他们的盟友关系正式宣告结束
The U. S. Military alliance with them is officially over.

1491
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:24,690
正如议会中多数党领袖…
In the words of the House Majority Leader,

1492
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:26,530
就本次决议回答了提问
the sponsor of today's resolution,

1493
01:23:26,620 --> 01:23:27,780
- “我们的良心不允许我们…” - 好的
- "We cannot in good conscience.... " - Okay.

1494
01:23:27,870 --> 01:23:29,580
什么？他们不能这么做
What? They can't do this.

1495
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:31,000
你得告诉他们 他们不能这样做
You gotta tell them. They can't do that.

1496
01:23:31,060 --> 01:23:32,700
好的 政府已经下令 行动吧
Okay. It's official. It's a go, people.

1497
01:23:32,710 --> 01:23:35,000
汽车人是我们的盟友 我们曾并肩作战 生死与共
These are our allies. The Autobots fought for us. They fought with us.

1498
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:36,120
结果怎么样呢？
And where are we now?

1499
01:23:36,220 --> 01:23:37,750
兵临城下
Facing an enemy invasion

1500
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:40,500
而且敌方兵力无法估量
with an enemy that has the means to deploy countless more.

1501
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,510
如果你还知道些什么
If there is any more you know,

1502
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:48,090
任何关于敌人意图的讯息
anything at all about the enemy's intentions,

1503
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:50,760
现在该告诉我了
now is the time to tell.

1504
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,940
汽车人没办法离开地球
Autobots have no way of leaving this planet.

1505
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:55,930
你说错了
And that is where you're wrong.

1506
01:23:56,990 --> 01:23:58,980
飞船名叫苍耳号
Its name is the Xanthium.

1507
01:23:59,610 --> 01:24:01,020
就是它运来了第二批汽车人
It brought the second wave of Autobots

1508
01:24:01,110 --> 01:24:03,610
此后一直由国家航空航天局保管和研究
and it's been under NASA 's care and study ever since.

1509
01:24:04,450 --> 01:24:06,190
我们将它和一艘退役航天飞机捆绑
We linked it with a decommissioned shuttle

1510
01:24:06,290 --> 01:24:08,950
使其在汽车人离开之前都处于军方控制之下
to maintain military control until they're gone.

1511
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:13,160
那个脆弱的螺栓将承受到一万磅的扭力 不是19！
Gonna be 10,000 pounds of torque on that itsy-bitsy bolt, not 19!

1512
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,620
你们是在拿我同伴的生命冒险！鄙视你们！
You're gonna risk the lives of all me mates! I'll ball you!

1513
01:24:16,510 --> 01:24:19,210
那是雷霆拯救队 他们负责维护苍耳号
These guys are the Wreck ers. They take care of the Xanthium.

1514
01:24:19,300 --> 01:24:21,380
我们一般不让他们离开基地 因为他们都不是好鸟
We don't let them off the base much, 'cause they're assholes.

1515
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,500
你要用力拉 你个废物！
You gotta pull that, ya nancy swanker!

1516
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:25,050
扭力太强了会杀了他的！
It's time to kill him!

1517
01:24:25,140 --> 01:24:27,050
我只是帮忙而已 做我本职工作
I'm just trying to help, you know. Just doing my job.

1518
01:24:27,140 --> 01:24:29,600
冷静点 离他远点 这是人类
Just calm down. Leave him alone. This is a human being.

1519
01:24:29,690 --> 01:24:31,770
- 艾普斯！ - 你简直不可理喻！
- Epps! - You are ridiculous!

1520
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,090
- 是你吗？ - 嗨 伙计！
- Is that you? - What up, man?

1521
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:34,970
你怎么在这里？
What are you doing here?

1522
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,650
我从空军退役了
I retired from the Air Force.

1523
01:24:37,150 --> 01:24:38,480
放开我的手行吗？
Can you let my hand go?

1524
01:24:39,700 --> 01:24:41,030
你这是怎么了？
What the hell was that?

1525
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:43,400
退役后我来到这儿做顾问和协调工作
Now I just consult to run interference for them.

1526
01:24:43,490 --> 01:24:44,730
你是在帮倒忙！
Well, you're not helping!

1527
01:24:44,830 --> 01:24:48,110
不用打仗也不用被外星人追杀 我得到了理想的工作
No more combat and aliens shooting at my ass. I got a dream job.

1528
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:50,110
是时候占领这个星球了
Time to get off this planet.

1529
01:24:50,210 --> 01:24:53,570
他们要把汽车人赶走 你能相信这样的事吗？
Kicking the Autobots out. Can you believe this is happening?

1530
01:24:54,460 --> 01:24:55,800
你知道他们要飞往哪里吗？
Where do you think it's taking them?

1531
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,080
总之是地球之外的地方
Any planet but here.

1532
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:02,710
我想和这里的头儿谈谈
I wanna talk to whoever's in charge here!

1533
01:25:03,680 --> 01:25:06,110
我还以为是谁呢
Well, well, well.

1534
01:25:06,150 --> 01:25:07,760
是夏洛特·梅琳
Charlotte Mearing.

1535
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:10,260
西蒙斯探员 前探员西蒙斯
Agent Simmons. Former Agent Simmons.

1536
01:25:10,350 --> 01:25:12,590
看来你没死在华盛顿
So I see you survived Washington.

1537
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:16,650
华盛顿 埃及 失恋 我挺过来了 我还会活下去的
Washington, Egypt, heartbreak. I survive. I will survive.

1538
01:25:17,400 --> 01:25:19,020
他们正在动员所有的情报人员
They're bringing everybody in, kid.

1539
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:21,040
情报人员正在汇集所有的情报
Putting all the intel on the table.

1540
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:26,400
如果你以为驱逐9个汽车人就能解决问题的话…
And if you think deporting nine Autobots is gonna solve a damn thing...

1541
01:25:26,490 --> 01:25:27,730
这事我做不了主
It's out of my hands.

1542
01:25:28,540 --> 01:25:30,280
看来你高升了？
Moving up in the world?

1543
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:34,370
你的臀部真美
Your booty looks excellent.

1544
01:25:37,790 --> 01:25:39,250
你要是敢跟别人说起
If you ever say a word to anyone

1545
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:40,870
在匡提科那晚发生的事
about what happened that night in Quantico,

1546
01:25:41,510 --> 01:25:42,750
我就把你的心掏出来
I'll cut your heart out.

1547
01:25:43,510 --> 01:25:44,870
你早就掏走了
You already did.

1548
01:25:45,590 --> 01:25:48,630
山姆 听我说 别让他们驱逐我们
Sammy, listen to me. Don't let them exile us.

1549
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,430
- 别抛弃我们 山姆 - 这是霸天虎的圈套
- Don't let them take us, Sam. - It's a Decepticon trap.

1550
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:31,260
检查氮气量 我们准备发射
Check the nitrogen levels. We're booking out of here.

1551
01:26:33,930 --> 01:26:34,920
擎天柱？
Optimus?

1552
01:26:35,100 --> 01:26:39,600
你们的领导人说得对 这都是我的错
What your leaders say is true. This was all my fault.

1553
01:26:40,150 --> 01:26:44,310
我告诉他们谁值得信赖 实在是大错特错
I told them whom to trust. I was so wrong.

1554
01:26:44,530 --> 01:26:46,940
那不怪你 只是这举动更像人类而已
That doesn't make it your fault. It just makes you human for a change.

1555
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:48,820
记住
Remember this.

1556
01:26:49,530 --> 01:26:51,770
你们可以对我们失去信心
You may lose your faith in us,

1557
01:26:52,450 --> 01:26:55,440
但绝不要对自己失去信心
but never in yourselves.

1558
01:27:02,460 --> 01:27:04,330
我想知道你打算如何反击
I need to know how you're gonna fight back.

1559
01:27:06,050 --> 01:27:08,670
我知道你一定有策略 我知道你们会回来
I know this is strategy, I know you're coming back

1560
01:27:08,760 --> 01:27:10,670
会带援军什么的回来 我知道你们有计划
with reinforcements, something. I know there's a plan.

1561
01:27:14,980 --> 01:27:17,310
你可以跟我说 其他人不会知道的
You can tell me. No other human will ever know.

1562
01:27:19,060 --> 01:27:20,470
没有计划
There is no plan.

1563
01:27:22,150 --> 01:27:24,610
我们要是照他们说的做 到时该如何面对自己呢？
If we just do what they want, how are we gonna live with ourselves?

1564
01:27:26,610 --> 01:27:28,650
你是我的朋友 山姆
You are my friend, Sam.

1565
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:31,150
永远都是
You always will be.

1566
01:27:31,870 --> 01:27:34,150
但你们的领导人已经做出了决定
But your leaders have spoken.

1567
01:27:35,950 --> 01:27:37,410
从现在起
From here,

1568
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:40,620
你们只能孤军奋战了
the fight will be your own.

1569
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:55,510
长话短说
Make it short.

1570
01:27:56,520 --> 01:27:57,720
我们要上船了
We're loading up.

1571
01:27:58,640 --> 01:28:02,350
好了 动作快点！天亮就发射
All right, hustle up! We're launching at dawn.

1572
01:28:05,690 --> 01:28:09,400
我们会尽自己所能 让地球得到保护
We're gonna do whatever we can. Make it like it was.

1573
01:28:09,490 --> 01:28:12,730
你永远是我的朋友 山姆
You will always be my friend, Sam.

1574
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,160
我该走了
I gotta be going on.

1575
01:28:29,880 --> 01:28:31,750
多年以后 若子孙们问起
Years from now, they're gonna ask us,

1576
01:28:33,090 --> 01:28:35,210
当年它们占领地球的时候你们在哪里？
"Where were you when they took over the planet?"

1577
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,840
我们只能说
We're gonna say,

1578
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:42,380
我们只是在袖手旁观
"We just stood by and watched."

1579
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:47,090
<b>早上6:30</b>

1580
01:28:56,370 --> 01:28:58,730
你真的应当把这看成是一种合作关系
You should really look at this as a partnership.

1581
01:28:59,660 --> 01:29:01,320
你应当站在进步的一方
You have to stand on the side of progress

1582
01:29:01,410 --> 01:29:02,870
如果你想书写历史的话
if you wanna be a part of history.

1583
01:29:15,930 --> 01:29:18,670
七 六 五
Seven, six, five,

1584
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:21,590
四 三 二

一 零

1586

发射成功 全速推进
Go ahead and throttle up.

1587
01:29:51,550 --> 01:29:52,880
你想要答案 你已经拿到了
You wanted an answer. You got one.

1588
01:29:53,340 --> 01:29:55,100
我想要的都能到手 山姆
I always get what I want, Sam.

1589
01:29:55,140 --> 01:29:56,710
我们只是想确认一下
We just needed to be sure.

1590
01:29:57,220 --> 01:29:58,300
确认什么？
Sure of what?

1591
01:29:58,430 --> 01:29:59,640
他们乖乖上路了
That they would go without a fight.

1592
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,150
- 再说一遍 - 探测到不明目标
- Say again. - Tracking an incoming object.

1593
01:31:04,870 --> 01:31:06,240
我们现在都是在为霸天虎卖命
We all work for the Decepticons now.

1594
01:31:06,840 --> 01:31:11,490
<b>芝加哥市 伊利诺伊州</b>

1595
01:31:12,170 --> 01:31:14,330
我需要你帮忙追踪一个电话 那人在这个手机上
I need your help to track a phone call. There's a man on this phone.

1596
01:31:14,420 --> 01:31:16,460
他是霸天虎的人类代表 并且抓走了卡莉作人质
He's the head of their human operations and he has Carly hostage.

1597
01:31:16,550 --> 01:31:18,380
你给我坐好了 别动
I want you to sit down. Don't move.

1598
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:21,800
跟我来
Follow me.

1599
01:31:22,720 --> 01:31:24,260
他马上就开过来
I'm watching him drive up right now.

1600
01:31:27,980 --> 01:31:29,810
电话是在路上打出的
The call was placed en route.

1601
01:31:29,900 --> 01:31:32,140
我现在要侵入手机摄像头
I'm hacking into the phone's camera now.

1602
01:31:32,570 --> 01:31:34,600
看 这是摄像头的实时画面
There, that's it. That's a live stream from the camera.

1603
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:37,030
这地方我来确定手机通讯基站位置
Someplace... Hold on. I can triangulate this.

1604
01:31:38,240 --> 01:31:40,400
确认 是芝加哥的基站 那里 找到了
Okay, it's Chicago cell sites. There, I've got it.

1605
01:31:40,740 --> 01:31:43,200
特朗普大厦 芝加哥 矮的那栋
Trump Tower, Chicago. Lower penthouse.

1606
01:31:43,370 --> 01:31:44,700
准备好了
We're on.

1607
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,780
- 我要去那里 - 你确定吗？
- I'm going. - You sure?

1608
01:31:48,870 --> 01:31:51,580
谢谢你帮了我 我十五个小时之内要赶到
She's done nothing but try to help me, and I can be there in 15 hours.

1609
01:31:51,670 --> 01:31:53,910
不能让你一个人去
You're not going alone.

1610
01:31:56,420 --> 01:31:58,880
在那里还有我的NEST老战友
I still got my NEST friends out there.

1611
01:31:58,970 --> 01:32:00,880
我会召集起他们 找到你的女友
I'll round them up, we'll find your girlfriend,

1612
01:32:00,970 --> 01:32:02,300
然后逮住那家伙
we're gonna bring this guy in.

1613
01:32:02,600 --> 01:32:03,960
你为什么要帮我？
Why are you helping me?

1614
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:07,300
因为那个混账也害死了我的朋友
'Cause that asshole killed my friends, too.

1615
01:32:23,450 --> 01:32:25,400
他们说想要地球的资源
They said they were here for our resources,

1616
01:32:25,470 --> 01:32:26,780
重建他们的星球
to rebuild their planet.

1617
01:32:26,870 --> 01:32:30,110
没错 但事实上只需要一种资源
Yes, but really one resource in particular.

1618
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:32,200
我们星球上独一无二的资源
One unique to our planet.

1619
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,200
我们？
Us?

1620
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:38,710
你很聪明
You're very smart.

1621
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,040
没有劳动力他们无法重建家园
You see, they can't rebuild without a slave labor force.

1622
01:32:41,630 --> 01:32:44,880
有哪个星球能提供60亿工人呢？
How many rocks up there in the universe offer six billion workers?

1623
01:32:44,970 --> 01:32:48,130
你什么意思？我们无法运送这么多人
What are you talking about? We can't transport people.

1624
01:32:49,100 --> 01:32:51,640
用不着把人带走 他们会把星球运到这里来
They're not shipping people. They're shipping their planet here.

1625
01:32:57,650 --> 01:32:59,060
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

1626
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:01,730
御天敌在这里干什么？
What's Sentinel doing here?

1627
01:33:01,820 --> 01:33:05,560
看吧 他们将数百能量柱放置在全球各地
Watch. They're spreading hundreds of pillars around the globe right now.

1628
01:33:05,660 --> 01:33:08,240
几个小时后 等它们被发射到轨道上启动后
In just a few hours, they're gonna launch them into orbit

1629
01:33:08,330 --> 01:33:11,570
就会将塞伯坦传送到我们的世界
and bring Cybertron into our atmosphere.

1630
01:33:11,660 --> 01:33:13,780
红色的那根是主控柱
The red one there controls the rest.

1631
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:15,910
一旦激活 传输就将全面启动
He triggers that, it starts the whole thing.

1632
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:19,870
滚开 小肉虫 你的任务已经结束了
Be gone, insect operative. Your work is done.

1633
01:33:20,170 --> 01:33:22,330
遵命 阁下 他真是个混蛋
Your Excellency. He's such a dick.

1634
01:33:27,140 --> 01:33:30,130
- 你希望悲剧发生吗？ - 我只希望能活着 多活40年而已
- You want this to happen? - I want to survive. I want 40 more years.

1635
01:33:30,230 --> 01:33:32,890
你以为我想这样啊？这都是客户要求
You think I asked for this? I inherited a client.

1636
01:33:32,980 --> 01:33:35,590
是啊 等塞伯坦来了 人类全成了奴隶
Yeah, and when Cybertron's here and we're all their slaves,

1637
01:33:35,690 --> 01:33:37,300
估计到时也需要个工头吧
I guess they'll still need a human leader.

1638
01:33:37,400 --> 01:33:39,730
少咒我 想活命就听我的
Don't jinx me. You want to survive, you listen to me.

1639
01:33:56,840 --> 01:34:01,630
该让地球上的奴隶们认识他们的新主子了
It is time for the slaves of Earth to recognize their masters.

1640
01:34:01,710 --> 01:34:03,330
封锁全城
Seal off the city.

1641
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:01,100
把狗都牵出来 带到后面去
Get the dogs outta here now! Get them in the back!

1642
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:04,770
我想他们没告诉你还有这计划吧？
I guess they didn't tell you about this part, did they?

1643
01:35:04,860 --> 01:35:07,190
我也不是每场会议都参加的
You think I'm at every meeting?

1644
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,520
我在这里很安全
Look, I'm safe.

1645
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:10,950
他们答应过我
They said I was safe.

1646
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:23,710
上路
Let's roll!

1647
01:35:30,470 --> 01:35:31,960
刚才还有讯号
We had a signal earlier.

1648
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:33,890
现在一点也没了
It's not working.

1649
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:39,500
当你站在灾难后的遗迹前
<i><b>You were standing in the wake of devastation</b></i>

1650
01:35:39,650 --> 01:35:42,200
现在播送一条全国紧急广播
This is a national emergency broadcast.

1651
01:35:42,210 --> 01:35:47,800
当你等待着不可预测的变化
<i><b>You were waiting on the edge of the unknown</b></i>

1652
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:50,940
芝加哥市已遭受猛烈攻击
Chicago has suffered a massive attack.

1653
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,860
此时灾难即将瓢泼而至
<i><b>With the cataclysm raining down</b></i>

1654
01:35:54,860 --> 01:35:58,910
你的内心哭喊着"拯救我"
<i><b>Inside's crying save me now</b></i>

1655
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:04,300
却无法忽视万分孤单的处境
<i><b>You were there impossibly alone</b></i>

1656
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:06,290
离开这里！回去！
Get out of here! Go back!

1657
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:19,850
一批外星人飞船包围了芝加哥
There is a ring of alien ships around Chicago.

1658
01:36:19,940 --> 01:36:23,520
我们的远程轰炸机刚刚被击落
Our high-range bombers were just knocked out of the sky.

1659
01:36:23,610 --> 01:36:27,570
他们无法突破城市上空 敌人的空中防线
They can 't get through enemy air defenses over the city.

1660
01:36:27,650 --> 01:36:29,110
我们的卫星也受到干扰
Our satellites have been jammed.

1661
01:36:29,200 --> 01:36:31,400
我们无法监控敌人的行动
We have no way to monitor the enemy's movement.

1662
01:36:31,490 --> 01:36:34,360
NEST的所有部队在葛瑞森空军基地待命
Our old NEST teams are on stand-down holding at Grissom Air Force Base.

1663
01:36:34,450 --> 01:36:36,070
距战区有10分钟路程
We're about 10 minutes from the battle zone.

1664
01:36:36,290 --> 01:36:38,820
特种部队正在试图进入市区
We have Special Forces trying to gain access to the city,

1665
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:40,780
步兵正在外围布控
and infantry is staging at the perimeter.

1666
01:36:40,870 --> 01:36:43,540
等等等等 怎么搞成这样了
Excuse me, excuse me, it just doesn't make sense!

1667
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:46,120
我们就看不到一点画面吗？
Can't we get any eyes in there at all?

1668
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:48,000
我们的侦察机都被击落了
They keep shooting down our drones.

1669
01:36:48,090 --> 01:36:49,420
他们把我们变成了瞎子
They want us blind.

1670
01:36:49,800 --> 01:36:52,590
但我们还有微型无人侦察机 可以试试
But we do have a couple of mini-drones we're gonna try.

1671
01:36:52,680 --> 01:36:54,960
是谁在管无人侦察机？
Well, whoever's manning these UAV drones,

1672
01:36:55,050 --> 01:36:57,010
问他飞机能否改飞特朗普大厦
can we try to redirect them toward Trump Tower?

1673
01:36:57,100 --> 01:36:59,460
那孩子 维特维奇正在赶往芝加哥的路上
The kid, Witwickety, was on his way to Chicago.

1674
01:36:59,770 --> 01:37:03,640
他说霸天虎的人类间谍就在那栋大厦里！
Said some point-man human op is there for the Decepticons!

1675
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,810
听着 如果说我知道什么 我只知道这个
Listen, if I know anything, I know this,

1676
01:37:05,900 --> 01:37:09,020
那小子就是外星人的跟屁虫
that kid is an alien-bad-news magnet.

1677
01:37:50,110 --> 01:37:51,690
我的天啊
My God.

1678
01:37:52,610 --> 01:37:55,270
我们要在这样的混乱之城中找到她？
We came here to find her in the middle of all that?

1679
01:37:55,370 --> 01:37:57,780
咱们真的要进去吗 艾普斯？
Are we really going out there, Epps?

1680
01:37:57,870 --> 01:37:59,200
我才不去
I'm not going in there.

1681
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:01,620
没人想进去
No one's going in.

1682
01:38:08,380 --> 01:38:09,540
我要去
I am.

1683
01:38:11,050 --> 01:38:12,460
你们不去 我也要去找她
With or without you, I'll find her.

1684
01:38:13,470 --> 01:38:16,710
你这是在找死 山姆 你就是想这么做吗？
You're gonna get yourself killed, Sam. Is that what you want?

1685
01:38:16,970 --> 01:38:18,330
你就是想这么做吗？
Is that what you want?

1686
01:38:18,720 --> 01:38:21,510
你大老远跑来这里送死？
You came all the way out here to get yourself killed? Huh?

1687
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:22,630
是吗？ 好好听我说
Listen to what I'm saying.

1688
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,470
她是因为我才被抓来这的 你知道吗
She's here because of me. Do you understand?

1689
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,700
听着 如果你执意要进去
Listen, if you go in this building,

1690
01:38:26,740 --> 01:38:28,370
即使她还活着待在里面
that's if she's even still alive,

1691
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:29,760
你也没有办法能找不到她！
there's no way you're gonna be able to reach her!

1692
01:38:29,860 --> 01:38:31,690
那你说我该怎么办？
What do you suggest I do?

1693
01:38:32,820 --> 01:38:34,150
全完了
It's over.

1694
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:37,900
我很抱歉这么说 但真的全完了
I'm sorry, but it's over.

1695
01:38:38,530 --> 01:38:39,650
不
No.

1696
01:38:39,950 --> 01:38:41,530
嘿 小心！
Incoming!

1697
01:39:29,040 --> 01:39:31,200
我们要杀他们个片甲不留
We will kill them all.

1698
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:38,040
雷霆拯救队 废掉他！
Wreck ers, kill him!

1699
01:39:40,220 --> 01:39:41,800
这会很疼
This is going to hurt!

1700
01:39:42,140 --> 01:39:43,920
相当疼
A lot!

1701
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:52,180
你们的领导人不明白
Your leaders will now understand.

1702
01:39:52,270 --> 01:39:55,560
霸天虎绝不会放过你们的星球
Decepticons will never leave your planet alone.

1703
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:59,480
因此 我们需要让他们相信 我们死了
And we needed them to believe we had gone.

1704
01:39:59,820 --> 01:40:02,990
今日 我们以自由的名义
For today, in the name of freedom,

1705
01:40:03,080 --> 01:40:05,410
正式向霸天虎宣战！
we take the battle to them!

1706
01:40:28,180 --> 01:40:30,600
- 我看到你们的飞船爆炸！ - 飞船？
- I saw your ship blow up! - The ship?

1707
01:40:30,730 --> 01:40:35,220
我们根本就不在那飞船上！我们只造船不坐船 不是吗？
We were never in the ship! We designed the damn thing, didn't we?

1708
01:40:35,320 --> 01:40:38,350
我们都藏在第一节火箭助推器里
We were hidden in the first booster rocket to separate.

1709
01:40:38,440 --> 01:40:42,060
然后就按计划降落在大西洋
Splashed down back in the Atlantic, just as planned.

1710
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:43,770
我们哪里也不去
We ain't going nowhere.

1711
01:40:43,910 --> 01:40:46,780
是的 没人能赶走我们
Yeah, no one's exiling us.

1712
01:40:48,830 --> 01:40:51,100
汽车人要留下来
The Autobots are staying right here.

1713
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:52,740
帮你们赢得战争
We're gonna help you win this war.

1714
01:40:53,170 --> 01:40:56,130
他们封锁了城市 形成防御要塞
They're surrounding the city to make a fortress

1715
01:40:56,210 --> 01:40:59,450
所以没人能看到他们在城内的举动
so that no one can see what they're up to inside.

1716
01:40:59,550 --> 01:41:03,090
我们唯一的机会就是奇袭
Our only chance is the element of surprise.

1717
01:41:03,180 --> 01:41:04,840
我想我知道怎么能看到
I think I know where to look!

1718
01:41:06,850 --> 01:41:09,680
微型无人侦察机接近特朗普大厦
Mini-drone is on approach to Trump Tower.

1719
01:41:13,150 --> 01:41:15,310
你说山姆上那里去了？
You're telling me Sam's headed into that?

1720
01:41:15,980 --> 01:41:17,060
可怜的小子
Poor kid.

1721
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:20,570
他可能永远到不了目的地
Probably never got close.

1722
01:41:21,070 --> 01:41:22,440
你会开这玩意 对吧？
So, you can fly this thing, right?

1723
01:41:23,990 --> 01:41:26,200
什么… 那是什么意思？马马虎虎？
What is that... What is that? What is that? So-so?

1724
01:41:27,200 --> 01:41:29,660
要是马马虎虎就会开 那就太悲剧了
So you so-so can fly this. That feels terrible.

1725
01:41:31,910 --> 01:41:33,250
我们给你殿后
We're right behind you.

1726
01:41:40,090 --> 01:41:41,420
好了 我们突进去

到下午的时候
As the afternoon falls,

1730

余下的能量柱将到达预定发射地点

1733
01:42:28,430 --> 01:42:31,260
我屈尊和你共事
I have deigned to work with you

1734
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:34,800
是为了确保我们的星球能幸存下来！

1735
01:42:34,890 --> 01:42:38,230
但我绝不会为你卖命！
I will never work for you!

1736
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:41,770
你最好够聪明记住这种的差别
You would be wise to remember the difference.

1737
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:06,250
我烦死了 我最讨厌等待
I'm so sick of this. I'm just sick of waiting.

1738
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:10,750
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1739
01:43:11,310 --> 01:43:12,390

走吧 快走
Form a perimeter! Let's go, let's go!

1755
01:45:35,320 --> 01:45:36,660
你疯了吗？
Well, you're crazy.

1756
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:39,950
这东西是我们的吗？
What is that? Is that us?

1757
01:45:40,750 --> 01:45:43,860
是军队的无人侦察机 试试看它能否运作
This thing's a military UAV. Stone, check and see if it's still working.

1758
01:45:44,080 --> 01:45:45,370
是的 还有动力
Yeah, it's still got power.

1759
01:45:45,460 --> 01:45:46,820
飞行控制中心 能接收到吗？

1760
01:45:47,250 --> 01:45:49,540
动一下镜头？随便做点什么呢？

还有他那些太空桥的零件

1772
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:13,770
他们就在芝加哥河旁边的一栋大楼楼顶
They're on top of a building on Chicago River.

1773
01:46:13,860 --> 01:46:15,270
也就是霍奇基斯·古尔德投资大厦
It's owned by Hotchkiss Gould Investments.

1774
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:18,150
那根主控柱是装置的核心 就在东南角的穹顶里
Now, the pillar that controls everything is in the southeast cupola.

1775
01:46:18,450 --> 01:46:20,660
你们要搞定主控柱 立刻摧毁它
You've got to destroy the pillar. You have to shoot down the pillar

1776
01:46:20,740 --> 01:46:22,950
不然他们就要把塞伯坦传送过来了 明白吗？
or they're going to transport Cybertron here, do you understand?

1777
01:46:23,290 --> 01:46:24,570
- 明白了吗？ - 什么？
- Do you understand? - What?

1778
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:28,370
给我查出那栋建筑和侦察机的GPS座标！我们走！

1787
01:46:43,980 --> 01:46:46,680
嘿 你觉得能用火箭弹打下主控柱吗？
Hey, think we could use that rock et to shoot down the pillar?

1788
01:46:46,770 --> 01:46:48,100
我们离那里有8个街区远
We're eight blocks away.

1789

想要打中的话 得再接近点

1791
01:46:51,420 --> 01:46:52,780
得确保视野清晰
We need a clear line of sight.

1792
01:46:52,820 --> 01:46:54,100
那需要过河
And it's across the river.

1793
01:46:54,110 --> 01:46:55,870
很难悄悄潜进去

联络国家安全局调来该地区的监视器分布图
Get NSA to send service specs for any cameras in that area.

1798
01:47:06,750 --> 01:47:07,780

那就只能穿滑翔衣飞进去
We're gonna have to wingsuit in.

1802
01:47:16,610 --> 01:47:18,540
这是接近那里的唯一方法
It's the only way to get close.

1803

震荡波无法同时应付我们所有人 雷霆拯救队
Shockwave can't hunt all of us at once. Wreckers,

1814

穿过缺口

1869
01:53:01,690 --> 01:53:03,350
开伞！ 开伞！

- 快点 我们终于到了！ - 爬到这里累死人啊！
- Come on, we're high enough! - This is a mother getting up here!

架上火箭炮！
Set up the rocket!

1873
01:53:18,870 --> 01:53:20,860
- 他们来了 - 武器配置？

29把机甲爆弹枪 20把D型穿刺枪
29 Bot-busters, 20 piercing D-Bot.

1875
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:28,620
那里 有穹顶的大厦
There, the building with the dome.

1876
01:53:28,800 --> 01:53:32,290
为了牺牲的兄弟们 我们这次必须成功
For our brothers, let's make this trip worth it.

1877
01:53:35,430 --> 01:53:36,460
哦 天啊

1878
01:53:39,350 --> 01:53:40,840
这栋大楼！
The building!

1879
01:53:44,900 --> 01:53:46,730
他们正在攻击大楼！
They're shooting at the building!

1880
01:53:50,030 --> 01:53:51,110
这主意可不怎么地
This is not a good idea.

1881
01:53:51,190 --> 01:53:52,810
- 什么？ - 待在这里不是个好主意
- What? - This is not a good idea.

1882
01:53:52,900 --> 01:53:54,360
- 大楼晃个不停 - 就听我说一句
- This building is unstable. - Listen, stop for a second.

1883
01:53:54,450 --> 01:53:56,480
我们要是不尽力一拼 那大家都得死
If we don't do what we came to do, it doesn't matter, we all die.

1884
01:53:56,620 --> 01:53:58,610
懂了吗？ 看你的了 加油 老兄！
Right? That's your target. Come on, man!

我才不管大楼塌不塌
I don't even care if the building collapses.

1886
01:54:00,580 --> 01:54:02,070
我都要吓出心脏病来了
I'm having a heart attack anyway.

1887
01:54:03,710 --> 01:54:05,320
大楼要倒了！
The building is going over!

1888
01:54:05,420 --> 01:54:06,750
- 稳住！ - 找掩体！
- Hang on! - Tak e cover!

1889

你没事吧？
You okay?

1905
01:56:51,330 --> 01:56:52,660
那鬼东西是什么？
What the hell was that?

1906

钻孔机器人饥渴了
Driller-bot is thirsty.

1907
01:56:59,260 --> 01:57:01,250
- 那个独眼恶魔正在看着我！- 什么？

1908
01:57:14,270 --> 01:57:16,480
他还带了个蚯蚓一样的霸天虎！
It's even got an uglier Decepticon with it!

1909
01:57:16,570 --> 01:57:17,810
不得不撤离！
We have to evac!

- 艾普斯中士 楼梯已经被堵住了！ - 我们被困住了！
- Sergeant Epps, the stairs are blocked! - We're trapped!

1911
01:57:40,630 --> 01:57:42,840
我们怎么从这里出去？嘿 快点！

噢 主啊 只要让我活着逃出去
Oh, Lord Jesus, let me just get out of this alive.

1913

快 得马上撤！

1914
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,930
霸天虎怎么老是有那么厉害的玩意？
Why do the Decepticons always get the good shit?

1915
01:58:00,030 --> 01:58:01,860
- 快跑！ - 我们要被吃了

- 抓紧！ - 把你的手给我！

1919
01:58:46,030 --> 01:58:47,570
哦 天啊！
Oh, my God!

1920
01:58:47,660 --> 01:58:50,020
把她丢到防火梯那里！
I'm dropping you on the fire escape!

1921
01:59:07,430 --> 01:59:08,460
山姆！
Sam!

1922
01:59:09,720 --> 01:59:11,590
离开这里！
We gotta move!

1923
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:27,610
我来救你们了！
I'm coming for you!

1924
02:00:22,540 --> 02:00:23,880
擎天柱！
Optimus!

1925

- 雷霆拯救队！ - 我们来了！
- Wreckers! - We're coming!

1926
02:00:27,800 --> 02:00:30,670
世界各地的霸天虎
Decepticons around the world,

1927
02:00:30,760 --> 02:00:32,720
发射能量柱
launch the pillars.

1928
02:01:03,670 --> 02:01:06,080
我们又迷路了！
We are so lost!

1929
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:07,500
总是被遗忘
Always left out.

1930
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:10,410
太棒了！
Ka-ching!

1931
02:01:12,590 --> 02:01:14,330
也该轮到咱们发号施令了
It's time to lay down the law.

1932
02:01:14,430 --> 02:01:15,970
即将搞点破坏啥的
About to bring some hurt now.

1933
02:01:23,940 --> 02:01:26,350
开始了！你看见了吗？
It's starting! You see it?

1934
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:31,230
小心！
Look out!

1935
02:01:39,290 --> 02:01:41,120
山姆和卡莉哪里去了？
Where are Sam and Carly?

1936
02:01:43,210 --> 02:01:44,910
我们往这边跑
We'll go this way.

1937
02:01:51,970 --> 02:01:53,380
我就让你干护送这一件事
I give you one thing to do,

1938
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:55,420
做一件事 你都能搞砸了？
one thing to do, and you drop the ball on that?

1939
02:01:55,510 --> 02:01:57,130
我可没答应做所有事！
I ain't signed up for all this!

1940
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:59,430
外星人朝我轰炸 东奔西跑 追个不停！
Got aliens blasting at me, running around, chasing me!

1941
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:01,760
我在教堂和建筑之间四处躲避并挣扎逃命！
I'm ducking through churches and buildings and all that kind of crap!

1942
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:04,810
都是胡说！我可没答应这些干这个 艾普斯
This is bullshit! I ain't signed up for this, Epps.

1943
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:06,060
我尽力不再吵了
I'm trying to keep it together.

1944
02:02:10,280 --> 02:02:13,860
- 真难得！只有你和我了！ - 卡莉！
- What a treat! You and me, alone! - Carly!

1945
02:02:19,240 --> 02:02:20,730

1947
02:02:26,580 --> 02:02:27,920
快跑！

你无处可藏了 小子！

1951
02:02:45,850 --> 02:02:48,100
还以为你会为我们效命呢 小子！
I thought you were working for us, boy?

1952
02:02:52,110 --> 02:02:54,650
不！山姆！

伦诺克斯上校 你们快救救山姆！
Please, you've got to save Sam!

1958
02:03:39,450 --> 02:03:40,860
- 你们得救救他！ - 他在搞什么？
- You've got to save him! - What the hell is he doing?

1959
02:03:44,410 --> 02:03:45,990
希望这玩意管用！
This better work.

1960
02:03:46,120 --> 02:03:48,200
D型弹！D型弹！
D-Bots! D-Bots!

1961
02:04:01,220 --> 02:04:03,710
我看不见了！看不见了！
I can't see! I can't see!

1962
02:04:03,850 --> 02:04:04,880
山姆！
Sam!

1963
02:04:04,970 --> 02:04:06,840
抓住我的手！抓住刀子！用刀割！
It's on my hand! Grab the knife! Knife!

1964
02:04:06,940 --> 02:04:08,220
- 我在试！ - 刀 刀 刀！
- I'm trying! - Knife, knife, knife, knife, knife!

1965
02:04:08,730 --> 02:04:12,440
炸弹要爆炸！炸弹要…
The bomb's gonna blow! The bomb's gonna...

1966
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:14,480
你们这些人渣！
You human scum!

1967
02:04:14,570 --> 02:04:16,480
- 只有二十秒炸弹要爆炸了！ - 什么炸弹？

02:04:37,090 --> 02:04:39,210
我要杀…
I'm gonna kill...

1974
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:58,020
他死掉了

1975
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:02,570
嘿 现在大黄蜂要去跟其他汽车人汇合
Hey, Bee's going to run with the rest of the Autobots

1976
02:05:02,660 --> 02:05:03,940
- 到河边去与我们会合 - 好的
- and meet us at the edge of the river. - All right.

1977
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:35,600
它把我们吸进来了！我也不想这样！
It sucked me in! There was nothing I could do!

1978
02:05:37,320 --> 02:05:38,930
这下麻烦大了…
This is a total cluster...

1979
02:05:39,610 --> 02:05:42,100
我们必须过河
We got to get across the river.

1980
02:05:42,200 --> 02:05:43,860
你看见那个了吗？卡莉说太空桥控制柱
You see that? She said the control pillar

1981
02:05:43,950 --> 02:05:45,190
- 就在第一个穹顶里 - 好的

1982
02:05:45,700 --> 02:05:48,280
快跑！行动！前进！
Let's go! Move! Let's move!

1983
02:05:48,830 --> 02:05:50,860
战斧导弹已经发射
Tomahawks are inbound.

1984
02:05:52,230 --> 02:05:53,810
预计20分钟后到达
ETA, twenty minutes.

1985
02:05:53,820 --> 02:05:55,290
我进入路况监视系统了
I'm in the traffic cameras.

1986
02:05:56,130 --> 02:05:58,160
有4名汽车人被俘
Four Autobots are captured.

1987
02:05:58,380 --> 02:06:00,290
噢 天哪 我们孤立无援了
Oh, my God. We're helpless.

1988
02:06:00,470 --> 02:06:03,170
不管什么情况 讯号闪得越来越快
Whatever's set to happen, with those pulses getting faster,

1989
02:06:03,260 --> 02:06:04,470
肯定要出事了
it's gonna happen soon.

1990
02:06:05,140 --> 02:06:06,750
没有看到擎天柱
No sign of Optimus.

1991
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:10,050
我们怎么才能把这些桥降下来？
How do we get these bridges down?

1992
02:06:10,850 --> 02:06:13,090
全体散开 查看情况
Spread out. Check in there.

1993
02:06:14,900 --> 02:06:15,930
艾普斯！
Epps!

1994
02:06:16,020 --> 02:06:18,060
艾普斯 我找你半天了 你干什么呢？
Epps, I've been looking for your ass. How you doing?

1995
02:06:18,150 --> 02:06:20,730
撤退没有用 更糟的是
Retirement is wack. Even worse,

1996
02:06:20,820 --> 02:06:22,560
我们无法渡河到达那栋大楼
we can't get across the river to that building,

1997
02:06:22,650 --> 02:06:24,560
而对岸的汽车人全被霸天虎包围了
and the Autobots are upstairs, surrounded.

1998
02:06:30,870 --> 02:06:32,240
把镜头转过来一点
Just pan the camera around, all right?

1999
02:06:32,330 --> 02:06:34,240
好的 转过来 你来做

试着进入大桥主控室
Try getting into the bridge control room.

2001
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:41,670
他们在那里干嘛？ 光站着不动？
What are they doing? They're just standing there.

2002
02:06:41,760 --> 02:06:45,670
加油 达奇 想办法黑进大桥主控电脑
Hang on. Dutch, see if you can hack into the bridge.

2003
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:48,630
长官 海豹特种部队报到

别碰我！
Get off me!

2010

爆炸的震荡波能让它们短路

狙击手 射瞎他们的眼睛

连这么简单的道理都不懂
You simply fail to understand

2016

少数人的利益必须服从大众的需求

你得教他们学乖点
You need to teach them about respect.

02:08:51,140 --> 02:08:53,380
以前是公事公办 现在是私人恩怨 你懂我的意思吗？
This was all business, but now it's personal, do you understand me?

2037
02:08:54,970 --> 02:08:59,970
我懂 没有战俘 只有战利品
I understand. No prisoners, only trophies.

2038

大黄蜂 我觉得他们想要杀了我们…

转过身去
Turn around.

2051
02:10:15,050 --> 02:10:17,630
我们… 我们曾有过很多的回忆
We... We gave 'em a hell of a run.

2052

擎天柱

你忘了你的立场！
you forget your place!

2090

我给你带来了塞伯坦 你的故乡
I bring you Cybertron, your home,

2091
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:21,080
你依然要站在人类那边吗？
and still you choose humanity.

2092
02:16:21,170 --> 02:16:25,080
是你教会我自由权利归众生
You were the one who taught me freedom is everyone's right.

2093

我会重启能量柱！

我挡不住了！我需要躲避一下！
I can't hold them! The ships have us pinned!

2109
02:17:58,270 --> 02:17:59,680

导弹到达 还有10秒！危险接近！
Inbound, 10 seconds! Danger close!

2111
02:18:02,640 --> 02:18:04,930
解码M-L-E-F 14250！
Mark-Lima-Echo-Echo, 14250!

2112
02:18:05,020 --> 02:18:06,260
确信表面接触

2113
02:18:06,360 --> 02:18:07,850
- 请给座标 - 已获取目标

2114

- 迪伦！等等！ - 不！
- Dylan! Wait! - No!

2115
02:18:42,020 --> 02:18:43,050
迪伦！
Dylan!

2116
02:18:44,140 --> 02:18:45,550
住手！住手！
Stop! Stop!

2117
02:18:45,900 --> 02:18:47,140
不！
No!

2118
02:18:47,730 --> 02:18:49,640
你不能这样做 好吗？
You can't do this, okay?

2119
02:18:50,280 --> 02:18:52,230
对我来说只有一个未来
There's only one future for me.

2120
02:19:16,180 --> 02:19:17,900
塞伯坦
Cybertron,

2121
02:19:17,960 --> 02:19:20,580
你终于得救了
you are saved,

2122
02:19:20,590 --> 02:19:22,460
在最后时刻
at last.

2123
02:19:31,530 --> 02:19:34,640
你是来向我投降的吗？
Have you come to surrender?

2124
02:19:35,070 --> 02:19:37,480
- 这一切都值得吗？ - 当然了
- Was it all worth it? - Obviously.

2125
02:19:37,570 --> 02:19:39,610
你费尽心机救回了御天敌
All your work to bring Sentinel back

2126
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:41,700
而现在他却夺走了你所有的权力
and now clearly he has all the power.

2127
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:43,780
我都有点替你感到难过了
It's actually almost tragic.

2128
02:19:43,870 --> 02:19:46,990
你胆敢教训我 奴隶？
You dare lecture me, slave?

2129
02:19:47,080 --> 02:19:49,660
就算你的霸天虎最终征服这个星球
Your Decepticons finally conquering this planet,

2130
02:19:49,750 --> 02:19:51,080
他们的领袖也不会是你
and yet, their leader won't be you!

2131
02:19:51,170 --> 02:19:55,500
一定是我！ 永远是我！
It will be me! It will always be me.

2132
02:19:56,590 --> 02:19:58,670
再过个几分钟
In any minute now,

2133
02:19:58,760 --> 02:20:02,590
除了当御天敌的婊子你什么都不是
you'll be nothing but Sentinel's bitch.

2134
02:20:09,770 --> 02:20:11,430
小心
Rock et!

2135
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:14,110
去死！
Die!

2136
02:20:26,660 --> 02:20:27,990
你在选阵营时
You chose sides?

2137
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:30,160
选错了
You chose wrong.

2138
02:20:36,340 --> 02:20:39,170
你一直是我们中最勇敢的战士
Always the bravest of us!

2139
02:20:42,180 --> 02:20:44,720
但你总是无法做出艰难抉择
But you could never make the hard decisions!

2140
02:20:47,770 --> 02:20:50,810
我们的星球会生存下去
Our planet will survive!

2141
02:20:51,770 --> 02:20:52,980
不！
No!

2142
02:21:02,870 --> 02:21:05,900
我们曾经是神 我们全都是
We were gods once. All of us.

2143
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:08,370
- 但在这里… - 求你住手！
- But here...     - Please!

2144
02:21:08,460 --> 02:21:10,870
神只能有一个！
...there will only be one!

2145
02:21:21,800 --> 02:21:25,510
这是我的星球！
This is my planet!

2146
02:21:36,230 --> 02:21:38,190
我刚刚拯救了另一个世界！
I just saved a whole other world.

2147
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:41,240
你以为你是英雄？你以为你是个英雄吗？
You think you're a hero, huh? You think you're a hero?

2148
02:21:41,570 --> 02:21:44,030
不 我只不过是个送信的
No. I'm just a messenger.

2149
02:21:51,420 --> 02:21:53,120
太空桥仍然连接着！
The pillar's still connected!

2150
02:21:55,040 --> 02:21:56,450
小心点！
Bring it up!

2151
02:21:56,750 --> 02:21:58,960
- 大黄蜂！开始干吧！ - 来吧 来吧！动手 动手！
- Bee! Let's do this! - Let's go, let's go! Move, move!

2152
02:21:59,050 --> 02:22:00,660
它仍在运作！
Pillar's still connected!

2153
02:22:00,760 --> 02:22:03,000
摧毁那根能量柱！
Rip that pillar down!

2154
02:22:26,280 --> 02:22:30,030
现在 我们应该停战
Now, we need a truce.

2155
02:22:30,120 --> 02:22:33,530
我只不过想重掌领导权
All I want is to be back in charge.

2156
02:22:33,620 --> 02:22:35,710
此外…
Besides,

2157
02:22:35,790 --> 02:22:39,580
没有我你能做什么 擎天柱？
